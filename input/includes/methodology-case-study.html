    <span class="c1">
        During 2020, a coalition of nearly fifty private sector organizations, including healthcare delivery organizations (e.g. hospital systems) formed to advance the rapid development and dissemination of computable clinical best
        practice guidance for COVID-19. &nbsp;The coalition tackled the need for classifying COVID-19 patients presenting in emergency room settings to inform recommendations for triaging patients to differing levels of care and
        settings.

            Content Team consisting of frontline emergency medicine physicians/providers and members of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) identified the need for a tool to evaluate and classify the severity of
            COVID-19 in the context of patient presenting in emergency department settings to inform recommendations on the disposition of patients. Anticipated clinical pathways included care in-home, general floor status,
            progessive care (more intensive and extensive monitoring) short-term observation in the ED, triage to intensive or critical care units (ICU), and/or transfer to another facility.

            Given the low level of formalized evidence, the urgent need by frontline providers for some guidance from expert bodies, and early stage of the entirely novel disease, &nbsp;the equivalent of a guideline development
            group (C19 DGWG Content Team and ACEP) determined that a rapid review of available evidence was needed to inform initial guidance, in contrast to traditional approaches.* Evidence from the rapid review could be leveraged
            quickly due to the affordances and capabilities of the CPG-IG and the ability to continually update this guidance as new evidence emerged (of note: a second iteration of this content has commenced at the time of this

    <span class="c17">Step 1: </span>
    <span class="c1">
        Perform a clinical assessment for initial severity classification and determination of further diagnostics. &nbsp;The clinical assessment itself consisted of vital sign values, the quick severity index (qCSI) based thereon,
        and an assessment of signs and symptoms as well as risk factors for developing severe COVID-19 disease or risk for poor outcomes. &nbsp;
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c11">
    <span class="c17">Step 2: </span>
    <span class="c1">
        For patients with the four most severe classifications, the recommendation was to order an escalating set of diagnostics (labs, imaging, functional assessments). For the least severe classification, confirm patient to be low
        risk and disposition to home with follow-up via home and/or telehealth with monitoring. &nbsp;
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c11">
    <span class="c1">
        The results of diagnostics or findings further informed the overall COVID-19 severity classification. &nbsp;Of note, the clinical assessment was to be continued up to disposition and could escalate the severity
        classification at any point, thus influencing further diagnostic testing and/or disposition. &nbsp;Thus, the clinical assessment is not merely a once-and-done assessment, but changing as a result of continual patient
        monitoring, additional diagnostics, and interventions. Thus the patients&rsquo; pathophysiology and clinical actions should be represented as a series of states.
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c11">
    <span class="c1">
        For the scope of the emergency medicine practice, the classification could only be escalated, not de-escalated during the patient&rsquo;s course of care in the emergency setting. &nbsp;A &ldquo;Fast Track&rdquo; to the
        Critical Severity Classification with disposition to ICU was identified and recommended for patients who required respiratory interventions (e.g., high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation,
        mechanical ventilation) and/or hemodynamic support (e.g., vasopressors).

            One of the earliest activities that the clinical knowledge engineer was to identify as many clinical concepts and potential data elements that may be used to express and/or infer those concepts for the scope of the
            entire guideline. &nbsp;The evidence (literature) was reviewed together with early summaries thereof, along with the initial draft of the severity classification and disposition guidance decisions. &nbsp;The concepts and
            respective data elements identified were fairly exhaustive and ultimately included a number of concepts not required for the logic of the COVID ED CPG &ldquo;proper&rdquo;. However, it was expected that while the vast
            majority of these concepts may represent elements of the evidence that might not ultimately inform the CPG logic for scoring and recommendations, they had potential to be of significant value in outcomes, health
            services, and clinical research and were of the nature to be collected as part of the feedback mechanism enabled by the &ldquo;eCaseReport&rdquo; (i.e. a clinical registry scoped to the CPG content).

            <span class="c17 c38">Overall Translation Approach from L1/L2 Work-Products to L3 Artifacts</span><span class="c17"><br /></span><span><br /></span>
            <span class="c1">
                The formalization of the CPG consists in the creation of a series of L3 artifacts which are expressed using standard and formal languages. A formal language is a language that is specified by means of a formal
                grammar, which makes it machine-readable, and is defined to have formal semantics, which makes it machine-executable. <br />
                <br />
                The process consists in a translation from a (structured) human readable language into a machine-consumable language and is usually a specific responsibility of a Knowledge Engineer. To ensure a faithful translation,
                the choice of language and tooling is critical. <br />
                <br />
                In the broad landscape of standards for knowledge representation and reasoning, each component of the CPG can usually be represented using different languages, which can be specific to a formalism (rules, ontologies,
                processes, etc.) and/or a business domain (healthcare, finance, etc.). The notion of using different languages based on topic and audience is normal in L1/L2 artifacts, where the choice usually involves natural
                languages (e.g. English, Chinese, and Italian) and multi-media (e.g. text, audio, diagrams).<br />
                <br />
                Analogously, L3 languages are chosen based on their fitness to express certain parts of the CPG. When multiple alternatives exist, mappings and translations can be used to derive alternative representations from an
                initial source. In this sense, the choice of the initial language itself becomes less dogmatic, but rather contingent on the Knowledge Engineer&rsquo;s expertise, availability of tooling and consumer priorities.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this sense, the FHIR architecture provides one candidate Knowledge Representation meta-language &ndash; the FHIR StructureDefinition &ndash; and several Profiles that can be mapped to ontology languages (e.g.
                OWL), rule languages (e.g. DMN, Arden Syntax), process languages (e.g. BPMN, CMMN). <br />

        When DMN is chosen as the primary language for the formalization of the Assessment/Inference logic, the initial DMN Diagrams are turned into formally executable decision models.<br />

        Most DMN decision modeling tools are equipped with syntactic checkers, semantic validators, testing and simulation tools that support the Knowledge Engineer throughout the process.The fundamental goal of this step is to
        further refine the preliminary decision tables / expressions into fully computable ones which can be executed and validated.

            <br />
            Languages such as DMN and CQL provide basic datatypes (strings, numbers, dates) that can be composed into more complex &lsquo;structures&rsquo; which carry correlated information through the computation. These structures
            are local, and thus optimized for, the inference logic, and do not necessarily correspond to the (much more complex) structures used to persist and exchange information (e.g. FHIR resources).<br />

        In the CoVid19 ED example, the qCSI score itself is a mathematical calculation based on the patient&rsquo; vitals which participates in a broader classification of the patient&rsquo;s disease severity. The severity, in
        itself an estimation of the current state of disease progression, is used to predict the likelihood and degree of the patient&rsquo;s devolving if left untreated. This assessment ultimately determines the indicated
        therapeutic interventions.

        The language of choice for the representation of Care Process Models is OMG&rsquo;s CMMN. CMMN is designed to handle &ldquo;adaptive&rdquo; Case Models, i.e. Cases whose course is determined by events whose sequence is not
        completely predictable at design time, and which require some strategic planning as the case unfolds.<br />
        <br />
        In a Case model, the primary notions are those of &lsquo;Stage&rsquo;, which can be used to model clinical stages (e.g. ED vs surgical setting) and/or disease stages, (Triggering) &lsquo;Event&rsquo;, (applicability)
        &lsquo;Condition&rsquo; and Task (Action). In particular, the sequencing of Tasks is driven by Events (e.g. Task B is enabled upon the event of completion of Task A)

        CMMN is compatible with DMN: (Decision) Tasks in CMMN can be linked to DMN Decisions, and the two languages can share data elements and data types &ndash; mostly by CMMN models reusing elements and types defined in DMN.
    </span>
</p>
<p class="c7">
    <span class="c1">
        CMMN also embeds expressions, which are not used to derive new data, but to evaluate the applicability of Tasks and Stages in reaction to certain events. CMMN is a formal language and has execution semantics. CMMN models can
        be simulated even during the authoring phase, and can be used to illustrate/validate different scenarios that correspond to (un)desirable courses.

<p class="c7">
    <span class="c1">
        Formal verification tools are not as common as for its companion language BPMN, but would be valuable. In particular, Knowledge Engineers should verify that Case Models are viable, i.e. it is impossible for a sequence of
        events to lead to a case that (at least according to the model&rsquo;s specification) cannot be closed other than by aborting the case execution itself.

        Representatives from the Content Team, SME Knowledge Engineers, and the Technical Knowledge Engineers conducted a detailed multi-session, cross-functional review of the initial drafts of the computable models described
        above- Clinical Ontology, Decision Models (DMN), and Care Process Model (CMMN) individually and collectively. &nbsp;All details of the models including their clinical intent and computational implications were thoroughly
        reviewed. &nbsp;Some of the offering environments (e.g., CMMN) further afford simulation to visualize how case examples would traverse the logic expressions. At each point in the model where either definitions and
        description logic (as expressed in the Clinical Ontology) or assessment/inference logic (as expressed in DMN), the respective models were reviewed. &nbsp;Feedback on adjustments to the logic expressions for
        process/orchestration (CMMN), decision and assessment/inference (DMN), and description logic (Clinical Ontology) were fed back to the respective knowledge engineers with explicit documentation. &nbsp;And questions and
        clarifications based on implications from the computable expressions were fed back to the Content Team. &nbsp;All team members were given explicit tasks and any implications that were determined either out of scope or not
        currently resolvable were also noted.

        The mapping of the expression logic requires a finer grained discussion. Both FEEL and CQL are functional, stateless expression languages. A translation between the two languages is possible with a few caveats:

<ul class="c5 lst-kix_7f78afighysn-0 start">
    <li class="c10"><span>CQL and FEEL handle </span><span class="c27">null</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and unknown values slightly differently</span></li>
    <li class="c10"><span>CQL covers the data/expression boundary more broadly thanks to the </span><span class="c27">Retrieve</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;operations, whereas BPM+ languages externalize that aspect</span></li>
    <li class="c10"><span class="c1">CQL provides native support for Terminology</span></li>
    <li class="c10"><span>CQL defines a broader set of primitive operators</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c7">
    <span>In general, CQL is </span><span class="c27">more expressive</span><span>: mapping from BPM+ into CQL is more likely to be successful than the inverse. Whether FEEL is </span><span class="c27">sufficient</span>
    <span>, then, remains an open question in general. However, the added expressivity of CQL is mostly used in two places: (i) the </span><span class="c27">Retrieve filters</span>
    <span>, which are isolated into the ontology-mediated data binding layer anyway, which is executed </span><span class="c27">before</span>
    <span>&nbsp;the decision/case models, and (ii) complex functions which should be encapsulated anyway (in fact, certain complex functions are better expressed using quantitative languages such as PMML anyway).</span>

                The set of core models can be augmented by means of additional derivations. This second category is different because the derived models are neither iso-semantic nor iso-pragmatic. Their generation involves the
                information in the source model, as well as some additional methodology / technique.
