**GIN McMaster Guideline Development Checklist Extension for Computable Guidelines**

**Guidelines Knowledge Level 1 (L1) Checklist**Â 

Our objective is to develop an extension of the widely used GIN-McMaster Guideline Development Checklist and Tool for the Adoption and Implementation of Computable Guidelines. This checklist extension is intended to be used as a tool to help guideline developers develop narrative clinical guidelines with knowledge Level 1 (L1) in clearer, consistent, and more structured approach so that their key information like metadata, evidence, and recommendations may be successfully implemented by informaticists in computable formats used in clinical decision support systems that would improve patient outcomes through evidence-based medical practice in a learning health system based on FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. This may cover clinical practice guidelines and their related systematic reviews, evidence reports, and supplementary data and materials.
