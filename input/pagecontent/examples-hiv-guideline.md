    * Anal intercourse without condom
		* Vaginal intercourse without a condom and with more than 1 partner whose HIV status is unknown
		* Individuals who exchange sex for drugs or money
		* Having STI
		* Partner with STI
		* Partner with HIV
		* Partner in other high-risk category above
* People requesting STI testing
* Patients with TB

### Indication for immediate screening:

* Request for pre-exposure screening prior to new partner

### Screening in pregnancy:

[Screening for HIV Infection in Pregnant Women](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2735344?appid=scweb)

* All women should be screened for HIV as part of early or initial prenatal screening
* Women in high risk category or in area with high prevalence of HIV should be rescreened in the third trimester

#### Consent:
*	Patient will be notified that testing is being ordered either in person verbally or in writing
*	Patient may opt out of testing at this time—if patient opts out this should be documented
*	Patient does not require counseling to be tested
*	Educational material should be offered to patient in appropriate health literacy level, modality and language

#### Testing:

Pregnant women in labor, recommend Rapid HIV test—otherwise routine HIV testing
*	Rapid testing: Rapid HIV test IF POSITIVE then:
    * also order HIV-1 and HIV-2 with HIV-1 p24 antigen IF POSITIVE then use routine testing pathway
* IF NEGATIVE:
* OR
*	Routine testing: HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies with HIV-1 p24 antigen with reflex (automatic) supplemental testing if positive
* IF NEGATIVE: STOP
* AND: If supplemental testing indeterminate:
*	HIV-1 RNA

* After all NEGATIVE testing:
    *	Routine safe sex counseling

* After all POSITIVE testing:
    * Optimally there would be an HIV treatment CDS pathway triggered
    * At a minimum:
        * Counseling
        * Referral for HIV specialty treatment
        * HIV viral load test

### Rescreening:
*	All individuals should have at least one lifetime HIV test
*	Individuals at high risk should be screened at LEAST annually:
    *	Selected individuals at highest risk should be screened more frequently up to every 3-6 months
    *	Individuals seeking STI testing should be screened at every visit

### Exceptions to screening* (2006 guideline only):
*	If prevalence in practice is <0.1%, routine screening can be omitted in patients who do not have any high risk factors and who are not pregnant
