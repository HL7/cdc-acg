introduction: >-
  The FHIR Clinical Guidelines Implementation Guide (CPG IG) provides a means of creating a computable representation 
  of a narrative clinical guideline that is faithful to guideline intent and supports the derivation of downstream 
  capabilities such as cognitive and decision support, quality measures, case reporting, and documentation templates 
  that direct clinical documentation in support of determining guideline compliance.

      This ballot of the Clinical Guidelines implementation guides incorporates feedback that has been received during the trial-use 
      implementation period. Feedback from production implementations of clinical reasoning capability as well as multiple content 
      development projects covering various aspects of computable guideline content development and implementation has been included.

      Major changes include:

      * Removed Shareable/Publishable/Executable profiles and referenced the CRMI IG for those capabilities instead (see [Profiles](profiles.html))
      * Removed the Using CQL and Libraries conformance requirements and referenced the Using CQL with FHIR IG for those capabilities instead (see [Libraries](libraries.html))
      * Detailed descriptions of activity flow (see [Activity Flow](activityflow.html))
      * Recommend an Immunization activity now uses MedicationRequest 
      * Added L1 checklist from GIN-NA working group (see [L1 Checklist](clinical-guidelines-development-L1-checklist.html))
      * Moved most example IGs to cqframework (see [Examples](examples.html))

      The following sections detail the changes that were applied for this ballot.
