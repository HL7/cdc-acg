<h3>**Knowledge Translation**</h3>


Knowledge translation has specific meaning within the knowledge engineering lifecycle process for knowledge engineers.  However, there are at least three perspectives on knowledge translation that must be considered in the context of co-developing a clinical guideline together with its formal representation as a CPG.  These include:



            1. The “activities involved in moving research from the laboratory, the research journal, and the academic conference into the hands of people and organizations who can put it to practical use” (ref)
            2. The translation between and across various levels of knowledge representation,  from narrative to semi-structured to structured to executable (described in detail below in “Knowledge Representation” section).
            3. The translation between equivalent or iso-pragmatic knowledge formalisms (i.e., representations, expressions) such as is done with concept maps between terminologies or as will be discussed further in the “Methodology” section (see BPM+ -to- CPG).

The broader perspective on clinical knowledge translation across the entire knowledge ecosystem provides perspective on various sources of knowledge and the nature of their content and metadata.  The translation between and across levels of knowledge representation is a well-established activity for the knowledge engineer as is translation between formalisms. Knowledge engineers have tooling and techniques to address these activities, and some even take into consideration their respective touch points across the broader knowledge ecosystem. However, there are ongoing efforts, tool development activities, and knowledge resources across the knowledge ecosystem that may provide additional benefits in efficiency, timeliness, and effort that may be taken into consideration when developing a CPG.
