# Common Pathway 

The common pathway provides an abstract or generalized description of the overall process of care delivery that relates to care settings and high-level care activities.  The common processes identified in this implementation guide are based on surveys of guideline content, both in the examples used in this guide, as well as other guideline content from various clinical domains and guideline authors.

The result is the definition of a [Common Pathway](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/common-pathway.html) that is intended to be applicable in any guideline-based care content, but not a specific localization or implementation thereof.  Using this common pathway, content can indicate where in the overall process of care delivery a given recommendation or intervention should occur.  

Content conforming to this implementation guide SHALL identify processes using the [Common Processes code system](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/cqf-recommendations/CodeSystem-cpg-common-process.html).
