<strong>Knowledge Architecture:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge architecture is the discipline of information system architecture
(Industry, Enterprise, Solution) with a focus on the principles, best practices,
means, and mechanisms by which the knowledge assets for the architecture's given
domain are managed including: acquiring, representing, stored, and organized.
Knowledge architecture includes defining the types and scopes of the various
assets, their metadata, as well as their relations.  This description of the all
the types and nature of knowledge assets, including the definition of their
metamodels including relationships to and in the context of  each other
(derived, composite, and related assets), may be referred to as the knowledge
asset ontology.

FIG XX. The knowledge architecture affords a means to formally describe the
clinical domain using computer-interpretible formalisms.  The knowledge
architecture defines the type and scope of various knowledge assets as well as
the relationships between them and their requisite metadata.  It explicitly
defines the nature of classes of knowledge assets through their metamodel. These
definitions as well as definitions of the relationships between the knowledge
asset types constitutes the knowledge asset ontology.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, as various asset types and/or their derivatives share many common
characteristics, the knowledge architects attempt to use common approaches and
information modeling concepts to ensure optimal reuse, adaptation, and subtyping
across knowledge asset meta-model definitions. In FHIR, this is done through
profiling of definitional resources (e.g. plan definition, activity definition)
and is enforced largely through a common approach in tooling to creating these
asset type profiles.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, to ensure reusability, derivation, association, and adaptability as
well as reduce rework and confusion by the knowledge engineering team a
consistent and accurate definition for knowledge asset metadata is often defined
in what may be referred to as the knowledge asset metadata meta-model.  In FHIR,
this is done in part through architectural oversight of resource and attribute
definitions as well as through the use of a common, shared Metadata resource.

<p>
<strong>Key challenges for Knowledge Architecture lie in: </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying accurate, representative, unambiguous, and useful domain
knowledge abstractions;
<li>Enabling accurate and suitable computable representations (or formalisms) of
those domain abstractions;
<li>Assuring that these computable knowledge representations ensure the highest
fidelity of shared meaning between artifacts directly consumed and/ or generated
by domain experts and ‘computers’; and
<li>Provide sufficient affordances for the support of the entire lifecycle and
evolution of domain and executable knowledge
<li>“FItting” with and being used within an existing ecosystem and various
communities of practices and technologies within it is to be used
<li>Enabling evolution and adaptation, or degrees of freedom, within all Tiers
of Functionality both for individual assets, as well as collections thereof-
including considerations for numerous alternative localizations
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Needs and best practices include:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Afford Reliability as well as Continually Evolve and Expand upon the
knowledge content (know general nature of knowledge, not just specifics) with
minimal (or even positive) impact on the Adaptability and Resilience of the rest
of the Architecture.
<li>Knowledge Assets for the given domain, business, or product (for which the
architecture belongs) are Managed including: created, captured (“elicited”),
stored, versioned, organized, shared/ exchanged, executed/consumed, delivered
and presented.
<li>Systematic means by which to Abstract core knowledge assets for optimal
(re-)use and continual evolution throughout the broader architecture.
<ul>
<li>Appropriate or optimal Separations of Concerns including by classifying
various Types or Kinds, Representations, and Expressions of knowledge and
<li>The Methods/Operations, Interfaces, and Parameters by which they are
operated upon as well as interact within the broader architecture.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Ideally, there would be One Source of Truth for any given ‘business logic’
(knowledge) to be consumed or utilized by numerous components/features
throughout the entire architecture and this source of truth is or can be wholly
severable from a specific implementation.
<li>To behave as such, a knowledge architecture must not only respect the
general Knowledge Architecture principles mentioned so far, but also respect the
nature (kind) of knowledge for the domain or business in which it is to be used,
or even more so, faithfully (and holistically) reflect the domain or business.
Therefore, Knowledge Architecture is at least as much about the domain itself
(e.g. Academic Medicine, Healthcare, Evidence Ecosystem) as it is the general
nature of (computable) knowledge.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowledge Architecture in the healthcare domain poses a particularly challenging
domain to architect knowledge for, and for which knowledge architecture
approaches, decisions, and implementations can have significant impact on the
usability and value of assets as well as for the efficiency and overall effort
of the knowledge engineering team(s).  Furthermore, the participants in these
activities include a broad and deep representation of highly technical and
specialized skills and foundational knowledge including clinical medicine and
healthcare delivery, computational sciences and software engineering, knowledge
and evidence ecosystem participants, and the knowledge engineering discipline.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Key considerations and principles:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Separations of Concerns- within and across the domain conceptualizations,
between knowledge formalizations, and across the translations or transformations
thereof
<li>Fidelity to Domain Conceptualizations- oversimplification leads to unwieldy
and value diminishing complexity to correct for, while appropriate complexity to
align with the domain yields optimal representations and their formalization
<li>Use of appropriate (well-fit) representations, expressions, and other
formalisms within individual knowledge assets to address the nature of the
domain conceptualizations for which they are intended to express
<li>Layers of Abstraction- abstraction layers are a means of hiding some of the
working details of subsystems, thus enabling the separation of concerns,
particularly for boundary issues at these separations.  To do so, abstraction
layers may even have multiple levels.  One typically finds programmatic
interfaces and/or specialized logic to address these layers of obstruction
<li>Sharing of knowledge formalisms across asset types to minimize complexity,
optimize value, and reuse knowledge engineering skill sets
<li>Existence and usage of content, information, formalisms, and interfaces that
already exist within and/or across the ecosystem where possible and appropriate
(e.g. fit-for-purpose)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowledge Architecture Principles as Applied to the CPG
</p>
<ul>
<li>Separation of Concerns in the CPG, see the sub-section in the  CPG Knowledge
Architecture (Conceptual Perspective) on Separation of Concerns.
<ul>
<li>Domain Conceptualizations in the CPG, see the section on CPG Knowledge
Architecture (Conceptual Perspective)
<ul>
<li>Fitting Representation/ Expressions see the individual Profiles in the CPG
as well as how they are employed in the Methodology Section
<ul>
<li>Layers of Abstraction is largely done within and across the knowledge assets
definitions themselves described in the respective sub-section on Knowledge
Assets in the Knowledge Representation section
<ul>
<li>Sharing of Formalisms is in large part why to HL-7 FHIR and many of its
various features; though other standards-based formalisms may be employed as
well such as is discussed in the BPM+ implementation in Methodology Section
<ul>
<li>Ecosystem ease of use is another reason to use HL-7 FHIR and in particular
the various related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) (FHIR Data Access,
CDSHooks, SMART-on-FHIR, etc.)

to define the clinical domain concepts as well  as identify the useful
computer-interpretable formalisms that may be used to express them.

<p>
FIG XX.  The knowledge architecture team must then situate the clinical domain
concepts to more accurately and comprehensively describe the domain of interest
as well as situate the computer-interpretable formalisms in the information

<strong>Boundary Issues at the Separations of Concerns</strong>
</p>
<p>
As described above, it is critical in knowledge-driven approaches to identify
accurate, representative, unambiguous, and useful domain knowledge abstractions
and for these abstractions themselves to respect domain-oriented separations of
concerns.  These separations of concerns must be respected within and across the
domain conceptualizations, as well as between knowledge formalizations and
across the translations or transformations thereof.  A related principle is
fidelity to domain conceptualizations, where oversimplification leads to
unwieldy and value-diminishing complexity to correct for gaps in fidelity, while
appropriate complexity to align with the domain yields optimal formalizations.
</p>
<p>
However, healthcare by its nature seems to have significant ambiguity,
particularly when a highly educated and trained healthcare professional is
trying to describe how they think and work to a specially trained and educated
information technology professional.  In fact, this is why many knowledge
engineers have dual training in both domains or the science that explicitly
addresses the intersection (e.g., biomedical and clinical informaticians).  Even
for well-trained and experienced knowledge engineers and architects can have
difficulty with boundary issues at the separation of domain concerns.
</p>
<p>
One of the most critical principles in dealing with these boundary issues is to
identify them, recognize that they exist, and then formulate a plan to
explicitly address them.   To a large extent, this takes experience and
faithfully adhering to knowledge architecture principles and best practices.
While there are almost always trade-offs to be made as well as timelines to be
met that must be further taken into consideration, the close, careful, and
thoughtful attention to these boundary issues helps improve time and effort,
value created, scalability, and adaptability.  This is why architecting should
happen before engineering and building.
</p>
<p>
There are several best practices for addressing these boundary issues once they
have been identified.  One such best practice is to use “Layers of Abstraction”.
 Creating abstraction layers is a means of hiding much of the working details of
a component, allowing the separation of concerns to facilitate both
interoperability within the knowledge architecture and across implementations
thereof.  In fact, the “concerns” themselves can be thought of as creating
abstraction layers. Often when modeling or architecting a “concern”, one creates
fit-for-purpose features for that concern that themselves may be abstracted,
which specifically address boundary issues with ‘adjacent’ concerns with which
it must interact.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, the boundary issue itself becomes fully abstracted as its own
concern.  Interfaces, or a means of interacting, between concerns may be thought
of as one such way of abstracting the concern of the boundary issue itself.  In
other cases, shared concepts (e.g., as information objects) are a means of
addressing the boundary.  In other words, some lower-level domain concepts may
be used by, used in, and/or belong to more than one concern but often playing
somewhat different roles.
</p>
<p>
Boundary issues specific to the CPG Knowledge Architecture are discussed in the
subsection on Separating and Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow.

<p>
<strong>Knowledge Architecture and Knowledge Content Management System</strong>
</p>
<p>
The knowledge architecture is typically developed and manifested in a knowledge
content management system since that is where all of the knowledge asset
definitions (metamodels), knowledge asset metadata, knowledge asset content, the
knowledge asset ontology, and the various features that leverage these
capabilities resides.  A knowledge content management system can further afford
the ability to evolve and update the knowledge architecture and all its
derivatives, while giving feedback to the knowledge architecture team on the
impact of such changes.  Likewise, additional knowledge asset definitions
(metamodels including metadata model), can be developed in the knowledge content
management system.
</p>
<p>
For more on the manifestation of the knowledge architecture in a content
management system and means by which it might be informed and or evolved, see:

Content Management System)” in Agile CPG Development Approach
