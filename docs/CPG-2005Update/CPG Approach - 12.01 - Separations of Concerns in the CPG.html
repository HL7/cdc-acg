<h2><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>
Separation of concerns is a design principle that creates a distinct and focused
attention on each aspect of the domain or topic. This means that, from each
aspect's point of view, the other aspect(s) are irrelevant; but it does not mean
that the other aspects are ignored. It is “being one- and multiple-track minded
simultaneously.”  (ref).  This concept has been used to address efficient and
effective approaches in software engineering, particularly as they pertain to
developing larger, more complex information systems. (ref)  The most common
application of this principle is to a three-tiered architecture (i.e. data,
logic, UI) and corresponds to the tiers of functionality discussed earlier.

FIG XX. Illustrating the separation of the Case (patient
clinicopathophysiological processes and their manifestations and qualifications
thereof), the Plan (the approach to the patient’s current, historical, and
potential future state of disease and well-being including medical
decision-making), and the Workflow (how the Plan is implemented either through
interactions with clinical information systems or through real-world human tasks
and activities.
</p>
<p>
In medicine, a very similar principal led Dr. Larry Weed to describe the
problem-oriented approach to the medical record and reasoning about patients’
concerns, including the well-known and commonly used approach to the SOAP note
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). (ref)   Dr. Weed proposed that
physicians were essentially scientists, except that as many scientist pursue a
singular (or few) hypotheses throughout there careers, a physician must
formulate and assess/test hypotheses for a given patient and often throughout
the day and therefore must break each issue down into a concern or problem.
Problem-orientedness and the SOAP note have further been shown to be an
effective cognitive framework for assessing and addressing patient concerns.
(ref).  Interestingly, Dr. Weed’s problem-oriented approach and SOAP note do
play into the CPG knowledge architecture, though not exclusively.  In healthcare
activities, there are at least several related but orthogonal axes on which to
separate concerns.
</p>
<p>
One major axis of separation is by each disease or condition, intervention
(e.g., procedure, therapy), and/or diagnostic (e.g., imaging, tests), though
these concerns often intersect or interact significantly. Similarly, care
setting (e.g., ambulatory, home, inpatient, ED, ICU) and generalized type of
care activity (e.g., surveillance, prevention, diagnostic workup, treatment
planning, disease and therapeutic response surveillance, recovery/convalescence,
survivorship) can be conceptualized further as  separations of concerns.  Many
of these separations are addressed through the scoping exercise of the guideline
development group and a given guideline intentionally focuses on a singular
topic or area of concern. This separation may be addressed by entirely distinct
CPG’s or by strategies within individual CPG’s.
</p>
<p>
Another major axis of separation is by kind of process, including: 1) patient
clinicopathological (i.e., pathophysiological and correlated clinical
manifestations) processes, inclusive of normal physiology (CPGCase); 2) clinical
decision-making and corresponding care process abstract from care setting
(CPGPlan); and 3) care delivery process or clinical workflow by which the care
processes are carried out in the context of a specific care setting where
multiple patients and healthcare professionals undergo, situational activities,
which may be inclusive of clinical information system or EHRs.  The CPG-IG
knowledge architecture is designed to respect the separation of these concerns
as discussed below.
</p>
<p>
A third major axis of separation of importance to the CPG-IG is significantly
related to the clinical workflow separation mentioned above, which itself may be
separated into the real-world care delivery activities in those activities that
are carried out in the context of clinical information systems (e.g., EHRs).
The separation of concerns addresses the type of workflow intervention and/or
enablement through which guidance is delivered into the care delivery process,
such as the cardinal types of CDS (ref) (e.g., alerts and reminders, order sets,
documentation templates, smart forms, data summaries), quality or performance
measurement or patient-level metrics or indicators, or more advanced forms of
workflow or cognitive support delivered via apps adjacent or supplemental to
clinical information systems (e.g., SMART-on-FHIR Apps).  Further consideration
for these interventions or enablement include the “CDS five rights”: the right
information; to the right person; in the right intervention format; through the
right channel;
</p>
<p>
and at the right time in the workflow.
</p>
<p>
In the CPG-IG, these interventions and enablement are recognized to be
downstream consumers of the knowledge content within the CPG with considerations
being made for critical content or information requirements thereof. Many of
these interventions or enablement had their own standard and/or IG’s (CDS-Hooks,
SMART-on-FHIR, Measure IG, eCaseReport-IG).  While the CPG-IG intentionally does
not directly address details of localized clinical workflow, it must and does
provide affordances conveying critical content for downstream consumers.  The
CPG-IG does this through several mechanisms, including “the common pathway”
(i.e., an abstraction of high-level clinical workflows), shared information
(e.g., CPGCaseFeatures), and reuse of the same standards for clinical
information system activities (e.g., requests and their lifecycle, tasks and
their workflow status) and interventions (e.g., forms, etc.).
