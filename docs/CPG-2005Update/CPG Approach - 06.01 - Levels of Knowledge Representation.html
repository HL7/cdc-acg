<strong>“Levels” of Knowledge Representation Framing:</strong>
</p>
<h2><strong>Approach</strong></h2>
<p>
The approach taken by this implementation guide is to consider three broad
challenges of clinical guideline implementation:
</p>
<p>
Note that the levels of knowledge representation are a continuum, with discrete
categories introduced in the methodology to help inform discussions and
communicate the concepts involved. Typically, the initial guideline content is
published in narrative form (L1), but guidelines will often contain diagrams,
charts, and other depictions that lean towards semi-structured (L2)
representation.
</p>
<p>
This implementation guide utilizes a previously established clinical decision
support (CDS) implementation model to move from a narrative clinical guideline
to computable content. This model defines four (4) ‘levels’ of knowledge
representation:

</p>
<h2><strong>Narrative</strong></h2>
<p>
Level 1 (L1) is the clinical guideline in narrative form often in Portable
Document Format (PDF), and includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clinical Focus
<li>Scope (population attributes from PICOTS, as well as interventions,
comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting)
<li>Recommendations (at least in part from PICOTS interventions)
<li>Strength of Recommendation and Quality of Evidence
<li>Evidence references (including analysis and evidence summaries)
<li>Who / what is included (inclusions) for each Recommendation or combinations
thereof
<li>Who / what is excluded (exclusions) for each Recommendation or combinations
thereof
<li>Policy considerations (e.g., privacy, access, regulations)
<li>For example, one such guideline is the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for
Chronic Pain (2016) published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Semi-structured</strong></h2>
<p>
Level 2 (L2) is semi-structured and generally consists of process and workflow
diagrams, user stories, and personas that provide contextual and descriptive
information about the steps involved in each recommendation of the guideline.
This level generally includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Personas - Who are the actors involved
<li>Concepts - What are the domain concepts involved
<li>User Stories - Functional descriptions of what happens from the perspective
of each persona
<li>Visualizations of Processes - (Flow) Diagrams depicting the order of actions
and decisions involved, often in parallel to the domain concepts or data
elements used as well as workflow and/or potential set of workflow interventions
to be employed
<li>Triggers - When do the processes happen (i.e., what are the entry points for
the processes)
<li>The examples included in this implementation guide illustrate some of the
types of content and approaches that can be used for L2.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Structured</strong></h2>
<p>
Level 3 (L3) is a computable representation of the content in the guideline and
can be shared across health systems and implementation settings. This level is
the primary focus of this implementation guide and as such throughout much of
this implementation guide when we refer to formalized knowledge assets (or
formalisms and expressions) we are almost exclusively referring to this level of
representation (computable).  They generally consists of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete value sets specified using standard terminologies
<li>Data element definitions describing the information involved
<ul>
<li>Including inferred data elements
</li>
</ul>
<li>Computable logic describing, at minimum, the inclusion/exclusion criteria
<li>Resource definitions with respective terminologies including for the
recommended activity itself (e.g. MedicationRequest + Value Set for a
recommended medication)
<li>Structured recommendations with decision logic (in the form of
event-condition-action (ECA) rules)
<li>Structured process definitions describing how the recommendations fit into a
clinical workflow (inclusive of decision and orchestration logic such as in
CPGStrategies)
<li>Structured form definitions providing a conceptual description of the
user-interactions involved (e.g. Adaptive Forms)
<li>All the CPG definitional resources (e.g. CPGPathway, CPGStrategies,
CPGRecommendations, CPGCaseFeatures, etc.) are Level 3 representations.
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Executable</strong></h2>
<p>
Level 4 (L4) is executable software running in a clinical system. This is the
local implementation and generally involves:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping of terms (value sets) to local terms
<li>Adjustment of workflow for site-specific factors
<li>Interpretation of computable content in the site-specific environment (see
Methods of Implementation)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As will be discussed further in the Agile CPG development approach (see section
on Knowledge Engineering), these levels of representation may begin to overlap
or blur and may not follow an entirely linear or successive progression for
sequential development maturation.  Furthermore, tooling capabilities may afford
translation across levels of representation and some levels may not be entirely
expressed as the tools user interface and internal translation capabilities
facilitate traversing these levels.  This will become more evident and described
in more detail in the section on the Agile CPG development approach.
