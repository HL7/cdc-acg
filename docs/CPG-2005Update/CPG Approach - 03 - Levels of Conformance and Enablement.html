<h1>Levels of Conformance and Enablement</h1>
<p>
<strong>Levels of Conformance:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Conformance Testing
</p>
<p>
Conformance with Features of the CPG
</p>
<p>
<strong>Levels of Enablement:</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are clearly trade-offs between effort, time-to-develop, capabilities
enabled, and the value that can be derived from any given CPG development
effort.
</p>
<p>
From very basic context for narrative snippets searchable in a library (or
Infobutton from EHR) to full clinical workflow enablement , cognitive support,
and pathway tracking (likely via SMART-on-FHIR App or deep EHR integration) as
well as feedback loops with real-world evidence of actual guideline usage,
measures, etc. as substrate for evidence ecosystem and/or eedforward loop for
evidence updates, point-of-need Pt-Like-This queries, and JiT ML inferrencing.
</p>
<p>
Level of Enablement (as well as effort) related to (all described below and/or
elsewhere in Approach):
</p>
<ul>
<li>CPG Features/Capabilities Implemented
<li>Intended Delivery/ Dissemination Mechanisms
<li>KR Levels formalized across CPG Features (capabilities described in CPG
K-Architecture)
<li>Tiers of Functionality
<li>Methods of Implemtation
<li>Mechanisms of Integration
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Roughly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Contextualized Narative (searchable)
<li>Contextualized Narative (deliverred in context)
<li>Contextualized Narrative with Patient-level Information (basic summary view)
<li>Actionable Intervention (+/- narrative and summary view; CDSHooks)
<li>Actionable Summary View (maybe CDSCards, AdaptiveForms, iFrame depending on
implementation/ integration)
<li>EHR Import of CPG (features determined and subsetted by EHR)
<li>Deep EHR Integrations with CDS Service
<li>Then add incremental effort for derived capabilities and how they interact
or are implemented (Metric/Measure, eCaseReport,
eCasePlanSummaryView/eCasePlanProgressingNote).  Some build on others.
</li>
</ul>
