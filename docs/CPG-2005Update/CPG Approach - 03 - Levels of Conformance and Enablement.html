<h1>Levels of Conformance and Enablement</h1>
<p>
<strong>Levels of Conformance:</strong>
</p>
<p>
One major effort on compliance is the WHO and Integrated Health Enterprise (IHE)
initiative on Computable Care Guidelines (CCG) profile of the HL7 CPG (<a
href="https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Computable_Care_Guidelines">ref1</a>, <a
href="http://www.ihe.ca/download/ambassador_headache_final_100_pager.pdf">ref2</a>,
<a
href="http://www.ihe.ca/download/ambassador_headache_final_100_pager.pdf">ref3</a>).
 The IHE/WHO CCG includes a minimum data set to be collected during an encounter
(i.e., required data elements as CPGCaseFeatures), logic to be triggered based
on data collected (CPGRecommendations), and reportable reportable health system
management indicators (CPGMetrics).  It can track and monitor care delivery
activities (e.g., what happened) as well as provide the ability to improve
guideline adherence.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conformance Testing</strong>
</p>
<p>
Levels of conformance will be based on alternative conformance profiles.
Conformance with Features of the CPG are still under development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Levels of Enablement:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Trade-offs between effort, time to develop, and capabilities enabled (and value
that can be derived) when developing a CPG.  From very basic context for
narrative snippets searchable in a library (or Infobutton from EHR) to full
clinical workflow enablement, cognitive support, and pathway tracking (likely
via SMART-on-FHIR App or deep EHR integration) as well as feedback loops with
real-world evidence of actual guideline usage, measures, etc. and as substrate
for evidence ecosystem and/or feedforward loop for evidence updates.
Fortunately, the CPG-IG includes levels of enablement that correlate to work
effort, time to delivery, as well as capabilities that it can support as well as
the means to iteratively, and successively develop CPG versions that provide
incremental value by ascending these levels of enablement.
</p>
<p>
Level of Enablement as well as effort related to (all described elsewhere in
Approach):
</p>
<ul>
<li>CPG features and capabilities implemented
<li>Intended Delivery and Dissemination Mechanisms
<li>Knowledge Representation Levels formalized across CPG Features (capabilities
described in CPG Knowledge Architecture)
<li>Tiers of Functionality
<li>Methods of Implementation
<li>Mechanisms of Integration
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Roughly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Contextualized Narrative (searchable)
<li>Contextualized Narrative (delivered in context)
<li>Contextualized Narrative with Patient-level Information (basic summary view)
<li>Actionable Intervention (with and without narrative and summary view;
CDSHooks)
<li>Actionable Summary View (maybe CDSCards, AdaptiveForms, iFrame depending on
implementation/ integration)
<li>EHR Import of CPG (features determined and subsetted by EHR)
<li>Deep EHR Integrations with CDS Service
<li>Then add incremental effort for derived capabilities and how they interact
or are implemented (Metric/Measure, eCaseReport,
eCasePlanSummaryView/eCasePlanProgressingNote).  Some capabilities and
enablements build on others.
</li>
</ul>

FIG XX. A given CPG may provide a distinct set of enablements, at singular or
multiple Levels of Enablement, or may go through successive versions in its
development lifecycle with increasing Levels of Enablement, particularly as the
impact of its recommendations and interventions prove to be correlated (or even
causal) to key outcomes and thus justify the effort.  Lower Levels of Enablement
may largely serve to collect guideline-related patient information to inform
guideline development in certain situations such as where evidence is scarce,
but needed very urgently such as an emergency response to a pandemic with a
novel contagion.
