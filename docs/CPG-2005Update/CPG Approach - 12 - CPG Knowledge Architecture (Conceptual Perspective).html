<h1><strong>CPG Knowledge Architecture-Conceptual Perspective</strong></h1>
<p>
The conceptual knowledge architecture for the CPG describes how the concepts
from a guideline and its recommendations described in the preceding sections are
realized as computable knowledge assets.  The CPG knowledge architecture
provides the framework through which the knowledge engineering team realizes the
guideline, its recommendations, and their various features through explicit
formalisms and ultimately as information.  The CPG conceptual knowledge
architecture together with the implementation instructions and examples in the
Methodology section provide the means to develop and concretize a CPG
representation that can be consumed through various mechanisms in end-user
workflows.

and any resulting or relevant orders, prescriptions, scheduling (CPGRequests)
and the data elements representing the events that fulfill these requests (a
subset of the CPGCaseFeatures)
</p>
<h2><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>
Separation of concerns is a design principle that creates a distinct and focused
attention on each aspect of the domain or topic...”  (ref).  This concept has
been used to address efficient and effective approaches in software engineering,
particularly as they pertain to developing larger, more complex information
systems. (ref)  Perhaps the most common application of this principle is to a
three-tiered architecture (i.e. data, logic, UI) and corresponds to the Tiers of
Functionality discussed in its own section.
</p>
<p>
In healthcare, a notable and critical axis of separation is by kind of process,
including: 1) patient clinicopathological (i.e., pathophysiological and
correlated clinical manifestations) processes, inclusive of normal physiology
(CPGCase); 2) clinical decision-making and corresponding care process abstracted
from the specifics of a given care setting (CPGPlan); and 3) care delivery
process or clinical workflow by which the care processes are carried out in the
context of a specific care setting where multiple patients and healthcare
professionals undergo, situational activities, which may be inclusive of the
clinical information system or EHRs used, in part, to undertake these
activities.  The CPG-IG knowledge architecture is designed to respect the
separation of these concerns as discussed below.
</p>

FIG XX. Illustrating the separation of the Case (patient
clinicopathophysiological processes and their manifestations and qualifications
thereof), the Plan (the approach to the patient’s current, historical, and
potential future state of disease and well-being including medical
decision-making), and the Workflow (how the Plan is implemented either through
interactions with clinical information systems or through real-world human tasks
and activities).
</p>
<p>
Disease or condition, intervention (e.g., procedure, therapy), and/or diagnostic
(e.g., imaging, tests) as well as care setting (e.g., ambulatory, home,
inpatient, ED, ICU) and generalized type of care activity (e.g., surveillance,
prevention, diagnostic workup, treatment planning, therapeutic response,
recovery/convalescence, survivorship) can all be conceptualized further as
separations of concerns.  These separations are typically addressed through the
scoping exercise of the guideline development group and may further be addressed
by entirely distinct CPG’s or by strategies within individual CPG’s.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, a key separation of importance to the CPG-IG is significantly related to
the clinical workflow separation mentioned above, which itself may be separated
into the real-world care delivery activities in those activities that are
carried out in the context of clinical information systems (e.g., EHRs).  This
separation is discussed in detail in the corresponding section.
</p>
<p>
Further details on the CPG Separation of Concerns and issues related to
Separating and Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow can be found in their
respective subsections in the CPG Knowledge Architecture section.
</p>
<h3><strong>Separating and Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Case</strong></h3>
<p>
From the domain perspective, a case is conceptualized as the contextually
relevant information oriented to clinically meaningful descriptions of an
individual patient’s current and historical state of health, disease, and risks.
 The case includes a comprehensive, detailed description of the current and
relevant historical clinicopathological presentation of the patient.  Key
information to sufficiently summarize the case for the purpose of making
appropriate and timely medical decisions in a given situation are often referred
to as pertinents (e.g., positive and negative pertinents).
</p>
<h3><strong>Plan</strong></h3>
<p>
WIthin the healthcare domain, the providers formulate an approach, or plan, for
how they intend to address the health, well-being, and active clinical concerns
of the patient, taking into account the patient’s goals and preferences.  The
plan includes current interventions, takes into account prior and current
response to those interventions, and formulates an approach to assess and
address all elements of the patient’s state of health and disease.  A plan
consists of requesting (e.g., ordering, prescribing, scheduling) medications,
procedures, diagnostics (e.g., laboratory and imaging, and other tests), and
appointments (e.g., referrals and consults).  Plan, Planning, and Care Plan is
addressed in further detail in the subsection.
</p>
<h3><strong>Workflow</strong></h3>
<p>
The CPG-IG explicitly does not address, local workflows due to their significant
variation, complexity, and need for consideration for local factors (e.g.,
specific resources and resource type, policies, customized or localized
tooling), as well as to avoid conflating detailed clinical workflow
descriptions/definitions with the flow of abstract clinical activities often
necessary to describe as part of the care process in guideline recommendations.
</p>
<p>
While the CPG-IG intentionally does not directly address details of localized
real-world clinical workflow, it must and does provide affordances conveying
critical content to end-user consumers.  The CPG-IG does this through several
mechanisms including “the common pathway” (i.e., an abstraction of high-level
clinical workflows), shared information (e.g., CPGCaseFeatures), and reuse of
the same standards for clinical information system activities (e.g., requests
and their lifecycle, task, and workflow status) and interventions (e.g.,
Adaptive Forms, CDSHooks, etc.).
</p>
<h3><strong>Boundary Issues at the Separation of Domain Concerns</strong></h3>
<p>
Theses specific issues are discussed in more detail in the subsection on
Separating and Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow and the principles for
addressing them  are described in the section on Knowledge Architecture
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples of Boundary Issues in the CPG:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstract, Local, and EHR (clinical information system) Workflow
<li>Clinical Assessment
<li>Proposals, Requests, and Events- Case or Care Plan?  Some in Both?
<li>Plan or Workflow-see sections on Knowledge Implementation and Separating and
Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow.
<li>Case and Workflow- information remains in appropriate data elements and
inferences thereon in their appropriate concern
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<strong>CPG Formalizations of Domain Concerns & Concepts</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>CPGCase, CPGPlan, and CPGCarePlan</strong></h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Plan</strong></h3>
<p>
    The plan, in the CPG context, as described above in “Separation of
Concerns,” addresses how the care team intends to address the active clinical
concerns of a class of patients, given a set of clinical parameters (described
further in  the case features and decision logic discussed below).  However, the
CPGPlan is constrained to the set of clinical interventions (e.g.,
orders/requests) scoped by a specific guideline recommendations in the CPG.
</p>

consisting of the CPGPathway Definition, CPGStrategyDefinition, and
CPGRecommendation Definition.
</p>
<p>
        <strong>Recommendations</strong>
</p>
<p>
        CPGRecommendations are the formalization of a singular narrative
guideline recommendation.  CPGRecommendations formalize and make explicit the
clinical activity to be taken or not to be taken.  The CPGRecommendations
formalize the decision logic or applicability logic to be applied to the
requisite set of data elements (CPGCaseFeatures) in order to instantiate the
proposed clinical activity resulting in a patient specific recommendation
(CPGProposal).
</p>
<p>
        <strong>Separating Clinical Decision Logic from Patient Descriptive
Logic</strong>
</p>
<p>
        An important note to the knowledge engineer to pay special attention to
the separation of decision logic about what to do for the patient from
description or inferencing logic that describes something about or the nature of
the patient (e.g. clinical pathological process, risk, severity, in qualifiers
thereof).  This greatly simplifies the decision logic as well as makes the
inferences about the patient readily available for other logic and/or other use
cases.

<li>CPGRecommendation as a profiled FHIR ECA Rule
<li>Directionality and Strength of a Recommendation
<li>Quality of Evidence and Evidence for Recommendations
<li>Evidence Resource Variables Informing CPG Formalization (Logic and
Semantics)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
        <strong>Strategies</strong>
</p>
<p>
        Strategies are approaches for combining, orchestrating, or associating
related guideline recommendations and typically scope to a particular concern
addressed within the guideline.  Strategies may be longitudinal, require
temporal orchestration, and reuse or repurpose data elements (CPGCaseFeatures)
and other components (e.g., the attributes and status of requests and events) of
the CPGRecommendations it scopes.  See section on CPGPlan for CPGStrategies as a
profiled FHIR ECA Rule.
</p>
<p>
        <strong>Pathways</strong>
</p>
<p>
        Pathways convey the full scope of guideline recommendations in a manner
that can be implemented for the purpose of guiding patient care within a
singular CPG.  In part, pathways serve a similar yet higher order function as
strategies, and serve the function of addressing interdependencies such as
decision and orchestration logic across multiple concerns.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Case</strong></h3>
<p>
The data that expresses a case consists of patient descriptors, exposures (e.g.,
environmental or behavioral, past and current medications and procedures),
physiological and pathophysiological assessments and descriptions (e.g., labs,
vitals), clinical presentation and progression (e.g., signs, symptoms),
diagnostic evaluations and physical exam findings, family history and genetic
markers, past and current diagnoses, risk and severity scores, ultimate and
intermediate outcomes in response to treatment. In the FHIR CPG, these
descriptors of the patient are referred to as CPGCaseFeatures.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
FIG XX.  The Case consist of all the patient descriptors including exposures
physiological and pathophysiological assessments and descriptions, clinical
presentation and progression, diagnostic evaluations and physical findings, past
and current diagnoses and procedures, related risk and severity scores, and
family history and genetic profile.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Case Features</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The features of the case are the clinically meaningful and relevant data
elements or information that describe the current and relevant past state of the
patient that is pertinent to the scope of the guideline recommendations and
related decisions to be considered.  These typically describe the
clinicopathophysiology pertaining to the condition(s) and state of disease,
potential intervention(s), and contraindications  related to guideline
recommendations.  These may include patient presentation (e.g., symptoms),
clinical assessments and observations (e.g., physical findings, labs, vitals,
diagnostic results, -omic profiles), diagnoses (e.g., problems or conditions)
including temporally related risk and severity scores, exposures (e.g., various
current and prior interventions such as medications/substances and procedures),
and other information that may be relevant to the scope of the guideline.
</p>
<p>
    Almost all primitive key features come from a subset of the FHIR Resources
and follow the event pattern.  The information from an event pattern (FHIR Event
pattern) describes an activity that has taken place or that is currently taking
place.  Case features in the CPG-IG are formalized and concretized as
CPGCaseFeatures that reference and/or profile numerous FHIR Resources from the
healthcare process domain (e.g., Clinical, Diagnostics, Medications).
</p>
<p>
    For case features requiring clinical judgement or assessment, an adaptive
form (see Adaptive Questionnaire) may be used.  Scoping of such required
information must be done carefully as to consider all guideline triggering,
decision, and orchestration logic that may depend on such information.
Similarly, the knowledge engineer must be careful not to conflate description or
evaluation logic with formal logic for how to interact with the end-user.  All
clinical description logic about the patient should be scoped to the case
feature and then may be used by the adaptive questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Separating Patient Descriptive Logic from Clinical Decision
Logic</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An important note to the knowledge engineer to pay special attention to the
separation of decision logic about what to do for the patient from description
or inferencing logic that describes something about or the nature of the patient
(e.g. clinical pathological process, risk, severity, in qualifiers thereof).
This greatly simplifies the decision logic as well as makes the inferences about
the patient readily available for other logic and/or other use cases.  This
takes particular attention from the knowledge engineer to disambiguate the logic
that evaluates the state and/or condition of the patient (or qualifiers thereof)
from the logic that describes how a clinician reasons over what to do for the
patient.

section:</strong>

<li>Derived or Inferred Case Features
<li>Case Feature Groups
<li>Case Feature Relationships
<li>Case Summary
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Care Plan</strong></h3>
<p>
A Care Plan can be conceptualized as the patient-specific or instantiated “Plan”
concretized against an individual Case.  The Care Plan describes the intention
of how one or more healthcare professionals intend to provide care for a
specific patient, group, or community for a period of time, possibly limited to
care for a specific condition or set of conditions.  In the CPG, the care plan
is scoped to the condition(s), intervention(s), recommendation(s), and other
relevant “plan” content in this limited context (e.g., contraindications,
correlated orders and results such as drug levels, or other orders or
fulfillments that must be considered in triggering, decision, or orchestration
logic).
</p>
<p>
The CPGCarePlan is constrained to the set of proposals (i.e. patient-specific
recommendations), clinical interventions (e.g., orders/ requests), or their
fulfillments (e.g., events) scoped by a specific CPG.  This includes those
related to the guideline recommendations, the strategies for combining guideline
recommendations, as well as the decision logic for each recommendation, the
strategies for combining recommendations, and how the overall guideline or
pathway combines or orchestrates all of the recommendations and strategies in
the context of a specific case (i.e., patient).  As described in the Methodology
section, the CPGCarePlan is modeled as a profile on a FHIR CarePlan Resource.

FIG XX. The CPGCarePlan With its CPGProposals and resulting or related Requests
and Events.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Proposal:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A patient-specific recommendation, that has taken into account all the
criteria in the computable decision logic and affords the ability for a care
team member to make a request (order, prescription, schedule) is known as a
proposal.  Such a request may be being considered for a plan, planned, proposed,
requested, or performed within a clinical information system mediated workflow,
further tracking of the state of completion of an activity may be supported
through the FHIR Task Resource.  “Being considered for a plan” means that the
activity or potential (see Request pattern) has not yet been fully evaluated.
“Planned” means that the activity or request is intended, but has not yet
entered the workflow.  “Proposed” means that the activity or request has been
suggested- either by a decision support system or another care team member such
as a consulting physician).  “Requested” means that the activity or request has
been initiated by an authorized healthcare professional or care team member.
“Performed” means that the activity or request has reached a state of completion
resulting in an event (see Event pattern).  Proposals carry sufficient
information to initiate a request.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>CPGProposal as a Patient-specific CPGRecommendation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A CPGProposal is a patient-specific instantiation of a CPGRecommendation.
As such, a CPGProposal carries forward much of the information content of the
CPGRecommendation, including all of the necessary definition for the request
including attributes or parameters that have either been defined explicitly or
inferred through the various decision logic of the CPGRecommendation or broader
CPG.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, patient-specific recommendations or proposals (and cliical
decision support in general) have been shown to be more effective and beneficial
when supported by recommendations-specific patient information. This
patient-specific information often includes the pertinent information from the
case that informs the decision(s) that the clinician must make with respect to
the recommendation (e.g., representing indications and/or contraindications for
an intervention).   In order to specify this information, a CPGRecommendation
may include scoped definitions of CPGCaseFeatureGroups or
CPGCasePlanSummaryViews

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Request</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The notion of "request" encompasses all types of orders (e.g., original
orders, filler representations of orders, reflex orders, etc.) as well as
proposals/recommendations for action to occur, plans, scheduling, etc. Any sort
of description of an activity that is desired where the description is specific
to the subject of the activity and the approximate timing of the activity would
be considered a request (see FHIR Request Pattern).  In the CPG-IG, a Request
may be the result of a proposal or may at least correlate to the proposed
request; however, there may be other Requests of interest to the scope of a
specific CPG, in particular a CPGStrategy and/or CPGRecommendation, CPGCarePlan,
CPGCasePlanSummaryView, CPGCaseSummary, or any of the numerous derived assets
such as the CPGMetric, CPGMeasure, CPGeCaseReport, or
CPGCasePlanProgressingNote.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Event</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An event is a description of an activity that has taken place or that is
currently taking place. It includes resources that primarily describe the result
of an request (e.g., activity) or is otherwise related to the request or
proposal (e.g., a condition or observation).  These Events also serve as
CPGCaseFeatures in the CPGCase. Boundary issues for dealing with events that
belong to both the CPGCarePlan and CPGCase are discussed in the section on
Separating and Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow.  Examples of Events include
medication dispense or administrations, procedures, encounters, questionnaire
responses, observations, diagnostic report, clinical document (i.e. FHIR
Composition), and many other found in the FHIR Event pattern.

<h2><strong>Derivative & Related Assets</strong></h2>

Another key feature of the FHIR CPG is that since it explicitly and formally
expresses the intent of the guideline, numerous additional features that have
been historically developed manually using the guideline narative, can be
derived directly from the CPG and/or reuse significant portions of the CPG, or
at least express relations to the CPG and/or its component assets (e.g.
CPGRecommendation).  More on derivative and related assets may be found in the
