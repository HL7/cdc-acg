<h1>Knowledge Representation </h1>
<p>
Knowledge representation is a surrogate, a substitute for the thing itself, that
allows for reasoning (human and computational) about the “thing”.  A knowledge
representation may be thought of on a continuum of successive degrees of
readability, of ability to reason over, and formalism (e.g., to compute).
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    In this section we will cover:
</p>
<ul>
<li>“Levels of Representation” Framework (degrees of formalism/ computability)
<li>Knowledge Assets (discrete representations with a purpose)
<ul>
<li>Asset Metadata (information about the assets and knowledge base)
</li>
</ul>
<li>Knowledge Architecture (designing and defining the types and nature of
assets)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>“Levels” of Knowledge Representation Framing:</strong>
</p>
<h2><strong>Approach</strong></h2>
<p>
The approach taken by this implementation guide is to consider three broad
challenges of clinical guideline implementation:
</p>
<p>
Note that the levels of knowledge representation are a continuum, with discrete
categories introduced in the methodology to help inform discussions and
communicate the concepts involved. Typically, the initial guideline content is
published in narrative form (L1), but guidelines will often contain diagrams,
charts, and other depictions that lean towards semi-structured (L2)
representation.
</p>
<p>
This implementation guide utilizes a previously established clinical decision
support (CDS) implementation model to move from a narrative clinical guideline
to computable content. This model defines four (4) ‘levels’ of knowledge
representation:

</p>
<p>
As will be discussed further in the Agile CPG development approach (see section
on Knowledge Engineering), these levels of representation may begin to overlap
or blur and may not follow an entirely linear or successive progression for
sequential development maturation.  Furthermore, tooling capabilities may afford
translation across levels of representation and some levels may not be entirely
expressed as the tools user interface and internal translation capabilities
facilitate traversing these levels.  This will become more evident and described
in more detail in the section on the Agile CPG development approach.

<strong>Knowledge Assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge assets or artifacts as they are often referred to in FHIR, where an
artifact is an instance of an asset.  Assets provide the ability to keep domain
logic separated and distinct from other system logic in complex systems.  In
this implementation guide we often refer to knowledge assets and knowledge
artifacts interchangeably, though the distinction is very relevant the knowledge
engineer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset Metamodel- its structure- requirements and constraints
<li>Content- what goes into the asset “container”
<li>Metadata- for detailed section on Knowledge Assets
<li>Composite and Derived- see section on Knowledge Assets
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Asset Metamodel</strong>
</p>
<p>
The asset meta-model is a model that essentially describes what is required
and/or allowed for a given class of knowledge assets.  In FHIR, the means of
defining asset metamodels is the FHIR StructureDefinition Resource (though it is
also used for definitions of resources other than knowledge assets including all
request (e.g. orders) and event (e.g. clinical data element) resources).
Furthermore, the PlanDefinition Resource (based on the HL-7 Knowledge Artifact
Specification) is a base, or more generic, asset meta-model definition that may
be profiled using StructureDefinition to further define additional asset
meta-models.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Content</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge asset content refers to that which is contained within a specific
knowledge asset.  This includes the scoped values or expressions for a specific
asset’s metadata, attributes, and other formalisms used to express the knowledge
contained within the asset.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Asset Metadata</strong>
</p>
<p>
Metadata is data that provides information about the knowledge asset.  This may
include disk active metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, and
situating or relational metadata.
</p>
<p>
In FHIR, asset metadata is addressed in several ways.  First, the FHIR
Resources, particularly those that are definitional(e.g., plan definition,
activity definition, measure definition, questionnaire) to be used as asset
“containers” have their own metadata attributes as defined with each resource.
Furthermore, shared metadata elements in FHIR Resources are described <a
href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html</a>
and more detailed information about FHIR Metadata may be found (ref), or here
(ref).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Expressions (and/or Languages)</strong>
</p>
<p>
An expression is a computable language for creating a computer-interpretable
representation of specific knowledge.  In HL-7 and for the scope of this
implementation guide, the expression language used (where its able to
sufficiently express the intended logic behavior) is the Clinical Quality
Language (CQL).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Declarations</strong>
</p>
<p>
A declaration is an expression of the structural elements of computable logic
(e.g. values for attributes and parameters of a knowledge asset) that does not
describe how to compute the logic, rather what the logic is.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Composite Assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
No single representation or expression can sufficiently and/or appropriately
describe the nature and behavior of many domain concepts using computable
formalism.  A CPGPathway, CPGStrategy, and CPGRecommendation are examples of
composite asset in this implementation guide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Derived Assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
Many knowledge assets may be derived from other knowledge assets (in part or in
whole) as a means to reuse and repurpose the content of the knowledge asset from
which they were derived.  For example, a CPGMetric may derive much of its
content from a CPGRecommendation.  Derived knowledge assets may be wholly or
partially derived from other assets.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Translation within and between Knowledge Representations</strong>
</p>
<p>
Some knowledge assets may be represented using multiple alternative formalisms
(expressions and declarations), yet express the same meaning and intent
resulting in identical behavior when reasoning over identical inputs (data
elements).  This equivalence in computational intent and behavior is known as
isopragmatism.
</p>
<p>
Curating and Managing Knowledge Assets in a Large Corpus (Knowledge Base)
</p>
<p>
For more on Curating and Managing Knowledge Assets (and their respective
knowledge architecture), see sections on Knowledge Representation in Knowledge
Engineering, and Leveraging a Knowledge Base (Knowledge Content Management
System) in the Agile CPG Development Approach.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Knowledge Architecture:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge architecture is the discipline of information system architecture
(Industry, Enterprise, Solution) with a focus on the principles, best practices,
means, and mechanisms by which the knowledge assets for the architecture's given
domain are managed including: acquiring, representing, stored, and organized.
Knowledge architecture includes defining the types and scopes of the various
assets, their metadata, as well as their relations.  In FHIR, this is done
through profiling of definitional resources (e.g. plan definition, activity
definition) using the StructureDefinition Resource to define metamodels and is
enforced largely through a compliance framework and a common approach in tooling
to creating these asset type profiles.
