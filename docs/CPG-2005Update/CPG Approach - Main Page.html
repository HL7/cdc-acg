<h1>Clinical Practice Guidelines - Approach</h1>
<p>
<em>***NOTE that the main page needs to be largely rewritten to give an overview
of the overall approach, yet sufficiently pull the key concepts together and
give a basic introduction prior to diving in to each section to understand the
overall approach.  Please refer to the separate documents in the same folder
that was shared for details of the individual sections.</em>
</p>
<h1>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h1>
<p>
Translating guideline recommendations and other types of guidance into practice
has historically been a site by site exercise that has been disconnected from
guideline or guidance development, creating unnecessary redundancies and
introducing potential errors in translation that can lead to inconsistencies in
how the guideline or guidance is executed. This clinical practice guidelines
implementation guide (CPG-IG) consists of standards and a standardized, scalable
approach to help make the effort of translating and implementing clinical
practice guidelines and other types of guidance more efficient and effective.
Two key aspects are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>An integrated guideline/guidance development and implementation process
(referred to as “the integrated process”)
<li>Common standards that can work across electronic health record (EHR)
platforms
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The integrated process brings downstream implementation considerations into the
upstream guideline/guidance development process by incorporating parallel and
iterative development of tools (e.g., clinical decision support (CDS) or
electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs)) as the guideline/guidance is being
developed. This includes gathering input from implementers (e.g., from the
clinical and informatics perspectives at clinical sites) on feasibility and
validity as well. In particular, the translation into tools applies common
health IT standards like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and
Clinical Quality Language (CQL).
</p>
<p>
How to use these standards to develop shareable, platform-independent tools
based on guidelines or guidance for a variety of diseases, conditions, or
preventive care is the primary focus of this CPG-IG. Secondarily, this CPG-IG
shows how using FHIR can help with other data-focused activities, such as public
health reporting (i.e., using electronic case reports) or quality reporting
(i.e., using eCQMs), that provide a feedback loop that feeds the evidence. The
evidence can be represented using FHIR (i.e., EBM-on-FHIR) and could be applied
in summarizing evidence and updating guidelines/guidance.

<li>Introduction and Rationale
<p>
The purpose of the CPG is: to enable computable guideline specification to occur
concurrently with guideline development; to faithfully express guideline intent
(including rationale and linkage to evidence-base); to enable efficient and
effective use and reuse of the guideline specification in downstream
capabilities; accelerate the development of computable guideline specifications
and interventions through an integrated, cross functional, rapid-cycle (Agile)
development process (inclusive of local implementation processes); to more
closely tie guideline intent, interventions, and measurements; and to provide
closed-loop (feedback and feedforward loops) across the knowledge, practice, and
discovery (or evidence) ecosystems.

<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Notes to Target Audiences:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The intent of the CPG Approach section as to convey various highly specialized
and technical participants in the Knowledge-to-Delivery-to-Discovery broader
ecosystem (that often interact with each other’s work products, though perhaps
not directly with each other) how the HL-7 CPG Implementation Guide recognizes
their distinct and valuable work and provides numerous affordances through
re-use of domain standards (e.g. FHIR and other HL-7 IG’s) and a
reconceptualization of work processes that share and reuse essential information
and content.  Much of this work has been informed by participation and
collaboration with several efforts including the CDC’s Adapting Clinical
Guidelines for the Digital Age initiative (link), the WHO’s XXX, the HL-7
Clinical Decision Support Working Group, and numerous other publicly funded and
private sector initiatives.

<li>Objectives
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The primary objective of the CPG approach to codifying clinical practice is to
accelerate the translation and delivery of expert body clinical best practice
recommendations to the point of care. The CPG-IG was developed through
multi-stakeholder engagement including guideline developers, implementers,
clinical implementations, standards experts, patient and caregiver advocates,
public (governmental and nongovernmental agencies), and others development
approach and means of expressing clinical practice guidelines and computable the
computer-enabled formats.  The stakeholders identified the need to concurrently
develop computable formats along with existing and evolving guideline
development processes. As such, the knowledge engineering process, inclusive of
elicitation, translation, specification, and formal representation, must be
integrated with the guideline development process and serve the function of
translating between the clinical domain and the formal, computable expressions
thereof.  It is the intent of this section to describe some of the fundamentals
of these activities as well as the concept, means, and performances to carry out
this activity.
</p>
<p>
Secondarily, we will attempt to describe how these activities interact with
adjacent and related activities as well as content and related standards across
the knowledge ecosystem. This will include upstream activities such as evidenced
generation and knowledge discovery as well as downstream activities such as
decision-support (CDS), patient care, advanced cognitive support (e.g.
SMART-on-FHIR apps), quality measurement and reporting, and electronic case
reporting (for similarly scoped conditions and procedures).

</p>
<p>
<strong>Levels of Enablement:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Trade-offs between effort, time-to-develop, and capabilities enabled (and value
that can be derived).  From very basic context for narrative snippets searchable
in a library (or Infobutton from EHR) to full clinical workflow enablement ,
cognitive support, and pathway tracking (likely via SMART-on-FHIR App or deep
EHR integration) as well as feedback loops with real-world evidence of actual
guideline usage, measures, etc. as substrate for evidence ecosystem and/or
feedforward loop for evidence updates, point-of-need Pt-Like-This queries, and
JiT ML inferencing.

<li><strong>Guideline Development Group</strong>
<li><strong>Scoping</strong>
<li><strong>Guideline Development Frameworks </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These Frameworks are used in Guideline development and across the evidence
ecosystem:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PICOTS Typology</strong>- Patient population, Intervention,
Comparator, Outcomes, Timing, Setting. The PICOTS Typology may be used for
scoping both the guideline (and individual recommendations) as well as the
supporting evidence or studies (e.g. meta-analyses and systematic reviews).
<li><strong>GRADES (G</strong>rades of <strong>R</strong>ecommendation
<strong>A</strong>ssessment, <strong>D</strong>evelopment and
<strong>E</strong>valuation<strong>)</strong>- GRADES affords a process and
structured framework for conveying information develop a common, transparent and
sensible system for grading the <strong>quality</strong> of evidence and the
<strong>strength</strong> of recommendations.
</li>
</ol>
<li><strong>Analysis of Evidence</strong>
<p>
Analysis of evidence includes systematic approaches for evaluating the evidence
to inform the guideline and individual recommendations.
</p>
<p>
EBM-on-FHIR
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommendations</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Recommendations are proposals pertaining to the best course of action put forth
by an authoritative source or body related to a condition, procedure, clinical
decision or activity.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the Guideline Development Group, if including appropriate
expertise, may provide further guidance as to if each recommendation serves as
sound candidates for performance/ quality measurement.
</p>
<p>
The Guideline Development Group may identify pertinent clinical or situational
concepts (data elements, terminologies) pertaining to each recommendation or the
guideline overall.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the Guideline Development Group may identify gaps in evidence that were
determined as part of the guideline development process. These gaps in evidence
may further inform data requirements to be collected as part of a CPG
eCaseReport.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reporting and Dissemination</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Reporting is often done through an official, formal guideline report intended to
be communicated externally to the target audience.
</p>
<p>
For the CPG, one might include dissemination to Measure Development
organizations, CDS vendors, EHR vendors, Registry vendors, and or a(SoF) App
developers.

<li><strong>Metrics and Measures:</strong>  A CPG_Metric is a patient level
measurement or indicator typically corresponding to recommendation compliance
and/or guideline adherence (corresponding to a process measure), reaching a
stated goal or objective (corresponding to an end or intermediate outcome), or
or current status of a clinical activity.  A CPG_Measure is a population level
measurement typically corresponding to an aggregate of patient level CPG_Metrics
and/or other parts of the CPG. .
<li><strong>eCaseReport:</strong>  A CPG_eCaseReport is intended to convey the
set of data elements required to provide for more detailed outcomes research on
the guideline topic itself as well as for a feedback loop for continuous
improvement of the specified  guideline.  Additional or supplemental data
elements (data requirements and inferences) for informing identified guideline
gaps or feedback loops may be further specified for inclusion in the
CPG_eCaseReport.

<p>
Knowledge Engineering is the discipline and profession of developing explicit
representations of advanced domain-oriented logic in computer systems
(knowledge-based systems) in order to try to simulate human decision-making and
high-level cognitive tasks. A knowledge engineer supplies or develops some or
all of the "knowledge" (typically in a knowledge base) that is built into or
used by computational systems.

<li>Knowledge Engineering Lifecycle Process
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Knowledge Engineering Lifecycle Process describes a progressively
interdependent series of activities or steps taken in order to transform domain
knowledge or content into a more formal computable set of assets for
consumption, execution, and or delivery.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Acquisition</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge Acquisition is the process of extracting, understanding, structuring
and organizing knowledge from one source, often solely or largely from human/
expert understandable formats, so it can be translated into
computer-interpretable (or computer-enabled) formalisms.

</ol>
<p>
Knowledge Implementation refers to the activities of localizing the knowledge
formalisms including addressing data bindings (e.g. data and terminology
mappings), workflow insertions and localization factors (e.g. adjustments to
thresholds), integration to end-user system endpoint interfaces, as well as
adjustment or issues related to data quality, timing, enrichment, and or
required data enrichments.

Knowledge Architecture is the discipline of Information System Architecture
(Industry, Enterprise, Solution) whose focus is on the principles, best
practices, means and mechanisms by which the Knowledge Assets for the given
domain to which the architecture belongs are managed including: acquiring,
representing, stored, and organized.  Knowledge Architecture includes defining
the types and scopes of the various assets, their metadata, as well as their
relations.  This implementation guide describes how the knowledge architecture
for clinical practice guidelines has been manifested within FHIR Resources and
the FHIR Architectural and Implementation Frameworks.

Across the top are levels of knowledge representation, from narrative text
(Level 1), through successively more structured representations, ending with
running, executable software at the right (Level 4). At the bottom of the
diagram, the <em>data</em> tier (T1) represents the concepts and data elements
involved in the guideline. Above that, the <em>logic</em> tier (T2) represents
the business and process rules of the guideline, and at the top, the
<em>forms</em> or <em>user-interface</em> tier (T3) represents the user
interactions with the guideline content.

<li>Separation of Concerns
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Separation of Concerns involves "’focusing one's attention upon some aspect’: it
does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it is just doing justice to the fact
that from this aspect's point of view, the other is irrelevant. It is being one-
and multiple-track minded simultaneously.”  (ref).  This concept was further
used to address efficient and effective approaches in software engineering,
particularly as they pertain to developing larger, more complex information
systems. (ref)
</p>
<ol>
<li>Case
</li>
</ol>
<p>
From the domain perspective, a Case is conceptualized as the contextually
relevant information oriented to clinically meaningful descriptions of
individual Patient’s current and historical state of health, disease, and risks.
 The Case includes a comprehensive, detailed description of the current and
relevant historical clinicopathological presentation of the patient.  Key
information to sufficiently summarize the case for the purpose of making
appropriate and timely medical decisions in a given situation are often referred
to as Pertinents (positive and negative pertinents).
</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan
</li>
</ol>
<p>
WIthin the healthcare domain, the providers formulate an approach, or Plan, for
how they intend to address the health and well-being, and clinical concerns of
the patient, taking into account the Patient’s Goals and Preferences.  The Plan
includes current interventions, takes into account prior and current response to
those interventions, and formulates an approach to assess and address all
elements of the patient’s state of health and disease.  A Plan consists of
requesting (ordering, prescribing, scheduling) medications, procedures,
diagnostics (laboratory and imaging, and other tests), and appointments
(referrals and consults).  A Plan takes into consideration existing or potential
complications, side effects/ adverse events for various intervention, and
worsening signs and symptoms to watch for, as well as the means to mitigate
and/or address those potential adverse events.

<p>
The data that expresses a Case consists of patient descriptors, exposures
(environmental or behavioral, past and current medications and procedures),
physiological and pathophysiological assessments and descriptions (labs,
vitals), clinical presentation and progression (signs, symptoms), diagnostic
evaluations and physical exam findings, family history and genetic markers, past
and current diagnoses, risk and severity scores, in response to treatment
including end and intermediate outcomes.  Relevant data elements may be inferred
from primitive data elements (e.g. BMI, eGFR) or may require clinical assessment
and judgment using primitive data elements (MELD Score, NYHA HF Class).
Medication and other substance administrations can be considered exposures and
even orders without corresponding events may be considered sufficient
descriptions of the patient’s past and current state of health and disease.
