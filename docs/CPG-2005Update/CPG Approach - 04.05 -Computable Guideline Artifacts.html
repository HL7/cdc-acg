<h2><strong>Development of Computable Clinical Guideline Artifacts</strong></h2>
<h3>Evidence</h3>
<p>
    Evidence and information from the evidence used and referenced in the
guideline recommendations may be formalized as FHIR Evidence Resources with
their respective Evidence Variables using the EBM-on-FHIR IG.  Similarly, the
published guideline narrative may be formalized through the same approach using
this CPG-on-FHIR IG..
</p>
<h3>CPG Content and Related Derivatives</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Recommendations: </strong>In the CPG context, recommendations are
represented and expressed through a profile on the FHIR Plan Definition
(CPG_Recommendation) largely derived from the ECA Rule profile.  The recommended
intervention corresponds to the “action” portion of an ECA rule and is largely
expressed as a Request through an Activity Definition.  The applicability
criteria and/or decision logic for a recommendation largely corresponds to the
“condition” portion of an ECA rule and is largely expressed using a combination
of scoped CQL (population criteria, decision logic, inferred data elements) and
FHIR Plan Definition (e.g., as a Decision Table). “Events” of the ECA rule,
correspond to either the state of or changes to the patient’s clinical condition
(data change event) as described in the recommendation (e.g., new diagnosis of,
risk score exceeds limit, blood pressure drops below threshold), or an
(abstract) patient or clinician workflow activity, the passage of time with
respect to some anchoring event, or some combination thereof.
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Guideline & Strategies:</strong>  The broader guideline includes
strategies for relating, sequencing, or orchestrating individual (or groups of)
recommendations and is represented and expressed through separate profiles on
the  FHIR Plan Definition (CPG_Pathway and CPG_Strategy).  A CPG_Strategy is
used to correlate, orchestrate, and/or provide decision logic between a set of
related recommendations often scoped to a particular clinical issue (e.g.,
diuresis in inpatient heart failure management). A CPG_Pathway serves a similar
function across Strategies and scopes the entire guideline.
<ol>
<li><strong>Metrics and Measures:</strong>  A CPG_Metric is a patient level
measurement or indicator of recommendation compliance and/or guideline adherence
(corresponding to a process measure), reaching a stated goal or objective
(corresponding to an end or intermediate outcome), or current status of a
clinical activity.  A CPG_Measure is a population level measurement typically
corresponding to an aggregate of patient level CPG_Metrics and/or other parts of
the CPG.  For a CPG_Measure, the initial patient population often corresponds to
the CPG eligibility criteria, while the denominator is often constrained by
individual recommendation applicability criteria (including exclusion or
contraindication criteria), and the numerator may correspond to satisfaction
criteria (order placed or activity performed)  for guideline recommendation or
proposal compliance in the case of process measures, or goal or threshold
attainment in the case of outcome measures.
<ol>
<li><strong>eCaseReport:</strong>  A CPG_eCaseReport is intended to convey the
set of data elements required to provide for more detailed outcomes research on
the guideline topic itself as well as for a feedback loop for continuous
improvement of the specified  guideline.  The data elements for a
CPG_eCaseReport come from the data requirements (CPG_CaseFeatures), key
inferences thereof (inferred CPG_CaseFeatures), patient specific recommendations
(CPG_Proposals), and the corresponding orders and resulting clinical activities
(requests and resultant events from CPG_CaseFeatures).  Additional or
supplemental data elements (data requirements and inferences) for informing
identified guideline gaps or feedback loops may be further specified for
inclusion in the CPG_eCaseReport.

    <strong>Value of Computable Guideline Artifacts to Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For Guideline Development Group, especially Medical Specialty
Societies</strong>- Actionable and meaningful usage of and feedback on guideline
recommendations; (automated) data collection of data elements relevant to the
scope of the guideline (registries); significant number of process of care level
and intermediate- and end-outcome metrics and quality measures scoped to the
guideline; active and highly relevant participation in the Learning Health
System.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For Providers and Health Care Organizations</strong>- Nearly
automated data collection for clinical registries (internal, professional
societies, and accreditation); a significant number of process of care level and
intermediate- and end-outcome metrics and quality measures; readily available
means to implement, monitor, and measure guideline-directed care; benefits
derived from participation in the Learning Health System.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For the Evidence Ecosystem</strong>- Utility of evidence and new
high-value evidence to “climb the pyramid”.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For modern and emerging methods of Knowledge Discovery</strong>-
numerous opportunities to leverage value of methods and data assets
(data-to-knowledge); new high-value evidence substrate to reason over (enriched
data, guideline usage, knowledge artifacts created across the value-chain).
