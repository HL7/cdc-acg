<strong>The CPG enables the System Level of the 6S Pyramid and Learning Health
Systems</strong>

The 6S Evidence Pyramid is another framing on the quality or validity of the
evidence that may be of particular interest to the CPG-IG (implementation guide)
 (ref).  A detailed explanation of the 6S Pyramid is beyond the scope of this
document, however we will explain a few key points as they pertain to the
guideline development process, in particular the quality of evidence as well as
how the CPG actually enables the ascent to the peak.

    The 6S Evidence Pyramid with Systems Level (integration of lower levels of
evidence into direct patient care) at the peak.
</p>
<p>
    The CPG has the potential to address the "systems" level (i.e., peak of the
pyramid), which is described as: “Integrating information from the lower levels
of the hierarchy with individual patient records, systems represent the ideal
source of evidence for clinical decision-making.” (ref).  The CPG affords the
ability to directly insert guideline recommendations into electronic health
records (EHRs) and clinical information systems based on reasoning over
real-world, patient-specific clinical data to be considered directly in the
context of clinical and shared decision-making.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, profiles like the CPGeCaseReport, inclusive of all
guideline-scoped patient information (CPGCaseFeatures), patient-specific
recommendations (CPGProposals) and their respective responses (as
CPGCaseFeatures), patient-level quality measures (CPGMetrics), and the corpus of
evidence available and used at the time of recommendation (CPGEvidence), allows
the informational means to further provide real-world evidence of the usage and
effectiveness of such recommendations.   This response and timing from
recommendation to when the clinician takes action on the recommendation (e.g.,
order, prescribe, schedule) and their fulfillments (e.g., administrations,
results, performances) as well as the patient-specific context for each key
event providing a view into critically valuable information about guideline
usage that itself may become evidence for various research studies that yield
their own high quality evidence.
</p>
<p>
    Intermediate and ultimate outcomes at the patient-level, including those
reported by the patient, could be collected by the CPGeCaseReport.  Lastly,
CPGCaseFeatures may include ‘snippets’ of narrative from clinical impressions
related to the response and/or other contextualization of a patient-specific
guideline recommendation or decision.  This kind of narrative explanation for
the clinicians' decision-making process or assessment may provide significant
insight into the impact and effectiveness of various characteristics of the
recommendation and/or CPG-derived decision-support interventions.
</p>
<p>
    Altogether, the CPG’s have the ability to deliver the lower levels of
evidence through the guideline development process and its referenced evidence
directly into patient care and related healthcare delivery processes as well as
provide individual, aggregated, and potentially continuous feedback loops on
both the patient specific recommendations (CPGProposals) and the resulting care
delivered and numerous relevant real-world data elements scoped to or by the
CPG.  This continuous feedback loop is often referred to as the “Learning Health
System”  (ref).

<strong>Evidence, Guidance, and Rapid Ascent to the Peak During an Emergency
Response to a Novel Contagion Pandemic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Clearly there are many benefits to enable such a “peak of the pyramid” approach
to tightly integrating guideline-directed care and cycling the “Learning Health
System” for any condition and at any point in time.  However, perhaps none more
so than a situation where there is a public health emergency with significant
mortality and where there is poor quality or low level of evidence for how to
best address the novel contagion as well as the clinicopathophysiological
(disease processes and manifestations) that it causes.  There are several clear
benefits and advantages to such an approach including the use of other
techniques, disciplines, and approaches described elsewhere in this
implementation guide.  We will address a few of them here and provide references
to where else in this document related content can be found.  Many of the
approaches, capabilities, best practices, tools, and techniques described in
this implementation guide are certainly as, if not even more, relevant to these
situations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapid Discovery of Best Practice</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the first priorities in a situation where evidence and best practice is
significantly lacking is to establish a means to start discovering evidence for
best practices.  In addition to typical public health incident case report
information (confirmatory labs and demographics), patient and population-level
information about the clinicopathophysiological nature of the human body’s
disease or disordered response to the contagion as is critical to have early on.
Likewise, information around the likely interventions for this disease or
disordered responses to the contagion together with information on response to
treatment as well as intermediate- and end-outcomes is critically important to
discover the effectiveness, timing, and contextualizing factors (e.g. other
patient-level information) for these interventions.  One of the earliest
components of a CPG to be identified and mature, and the set of required data
elements (CPGCaseFeatures) and key inferences (derived or inferred
CPGCaseFeatures) that are inclusive of requests (orders, prescriptions,
scheduled procedures, etc.) and various clinical data elements.  A CPG with few
or even no recommendations may be developed using the approaches in this
implementation guide with the primary purpose of collecting relevant data (see
section on eCaseReport).
</p>
<p>
Evidence of and for best practice may begin to emerge through such data using
various means including approaches described briefly and a high level and other
sections of this implementation guide (see section on Knowledge Acquisition and
in particular: Knowledge Discovery; Hybrid Approaches; and In Collaboration with
Knowledge Implementers)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapid dissemination of Practice Guidance</strong>
</p>
<p>
As evidence begins to emerge through such data through various means including
using approaches described briefly and a high level and other sections of this
implementation guide (see section on Knowledge Acquisition and in particular:
Knowledge Discovery; Hybrid Approaches; and In Collaboration with Knowledge
Implementers), best practice guidance (and/or guidelines) can then be rapidly
developed, delivered, and implemented using other approaches described in this
document (see sections on Agile CPG Development Process and on Knowledge
Implementation).
</p>
<p>
Alternately, with a lack of high quality evidence and available evidence-based
best practice guidance, some of the earliest (though low quality) best practices
may be actively discovered firsthand on the front lines and reported as case
studies or series studies (though low in evidence quality).  However, such
guidance in certain situations may be at least informative to frontline
providers, and inform additional relevant data collection on related
clinicopathological processes, interventions, and response (including outcomes)
thereto as described above (see section on eCaseReport).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapid-cyle, closed loop Knowledge-to-Delivery-to-Discovery with feedback
loops</strong>
</p>
<p>
In either scenario described above- rapid discovery of best practice, or rapid
dissemination of practice guidance, the ascent to the peak of the pyramid
through a rapid-cycle Learning Health System can be initiated.  Whether it be
data-to-evidence, or practice-to-data, the full closed loop knowledge
discovery-to-delivery lifecycle need not be dependent on evidence-to-practice as
is the usual case in the guideline development process and the supporting Agile
CPG development process.  There are numerous feedback, and feedforward, loops
described in this implementation guide that can facilitate continuous learning
as well as evidence updates. (see Agile CPG Development Process and
eCaseReport).  This cycle may be though of as either:
Data-to-Evidence-to-Knowledge-to-Practice; or
Guidance-to-Practice-to-Data-to-Evidence-to-Knowledge-to-Practice.
