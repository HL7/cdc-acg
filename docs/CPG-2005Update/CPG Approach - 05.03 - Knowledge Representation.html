<h3><strong>Knowledge Representation/ Expression :</strong></h3>
<p>
Knowledge representation pertains to the process of progressively structuring
and formalizing content for computer interpretation and enablement and details
of representing and expressing knowledge is discussed in an entire section
dedicated to "Knowledge Representation".   Here, we will discuss several major
implications of knowledge representation to the knowledge engineering lifecycle
process(-es) as they go hand-in-hand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Knowledge Curation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge curation is the activity of identifying, versioning, indexing, tagging
(i.e., adding metadata), and archiving the various artifacts and assets (e.g.,
representations, formalisms, expression libraries) relevant to the scoped
knowledge engineering activity. The primary purpose for knowledge curation is to
facilitate search and retrieval of relevant content.  This is often done within
a knowledge content management system or knowledge base.  In supporting large,
sophisticated knowledge engineering activities (e.g., as is needed for a
specific CPG and for supporting numerous related activities such as multiple
CPG’s and/or their derivative assets such as measures, clinical decision support
(CDS)), curation and a content management system or knowledge base becomes an
invaluable tool (e.g., as is needed for a specific CPG and for supporting
numerous related activities such as multiple CPG’s and/or their derivative
assets such as measures, clinical decision support (CDS)).   The knowledge
content management system serves the function of managing a large corpus of
reusable and related content and asset dependencies and  providing workflow or
decision-support for the knowledge engineers themselves across the knowledge
engineering lifecycle process and reusable assets.
</p>
<h3><strong>Knowledge Management:</strong></h3>
<p>
Knowledge management has substantive ties to  knowledge engineering, knowledge
representation, knowledge creation, and knowledge sharing and further extends
the broader concept of curation.  Knowledge management refers to the processes,
capabilities, and tooling for identifying, organizing, relating, finding,
sharing, and reusing knowledge assets (see section on “Knowledge
Representation”).  Knowledge assets and knowledge asset metadata are critical
features in knowledge management.  Knowledge assets are often stored in
knowledge content management systems and/or knowledge bases.    Findability,
reusability, dependency, and relatedness are some of the most critical features
of a knowledge content management system and rely heavily on metadata on the
assets.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge asset metadata includes structured information for identifying,
classifying, and organizing assets including: versioning, information pertaining
to the knowledge engineering lifecycle (status of an asset in its lifecycle),
administrative information (e.g. governance), permissioning, information about
the content of the asset, the asset’s provenance (derivation or from other
representation levels), human readable descriptive information, and information
about various kinds of relationships including dependencies, (re-)usage, and
similarities/ equivalence (see subsection on “Knowledge Asset Metadata” in
“Knowledge Representation section”).

Further details on how to leverage a knowledge content management system in the
Agile CPG Approach can be found in the section “Leveraging a Knowledge Base
(Knowledge Content Management System)”.
