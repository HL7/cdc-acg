# Overview

This implementation guide is a multi-stakeholder effort to use FHIR resources to build computable representations of the content of clinical care guidelines.

The process of guideline implementation is a significant challenge that is currently complicated by the lack of computable guideline content. Health systems and vendors implement evidence-based guidance, but almost always independently, leading to signficant duplicate effort, as well as inconsistent implementation. This implementation guide will build on experience from multiple guideline representation projects to establish the patterns and practices that support development and implementation of shareable computable guideline recommendations.

The initial ballot combines experience gained from multiple guideline representation projects, including Opioid Prescribing Support, Chronic Kidney Disease Management, Antenatal Care, HIV/HBV Screening, Prevention, and Treatment, and Immunization Decision Support.
