# Overview

This implementation guide is a multi-stakeholder effort to use FHIR artifacts to structure recommendations and content involved in computable guideline representation.

# Scope

The implementation guide focuses on the "leaves" of a clinical guideline, i.e. the guide establishes patterns, profiles, conformance requirements, and guidance for the patient-independent representation, and analogous patterns for the patient-specific representation of a recommendation.

# Goals

* Reduce duplicate development effort involved in the implementation of clinical practice guideline recommendations in clinical systems
* Reduce unnecessary and/or unintentional variability in clinical practice guideline implementation
