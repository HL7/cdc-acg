title: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Guideline Example
---

## Overview
The system-wide goal of evidence-based guidelines is to improve the patientâ€™s health and wellbeing by guiding health providers who are taking care of patients
with CKD along the management pathways that are supported by evidence and are thus considered the highest standard of care. 
The expected outcome of successful implementation of this guideline is to:
* Formulate an efficient and effective assessment of the patient's condition
* Optimize the use of therapy to reduce disease progression, reduce symptoms of CKD, and
enhance patient functionality
* Minimize preventable complications and morbidity
* Emphasize the use of personalized, proactive, patient-driven care
