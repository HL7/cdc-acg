<h3><strong>Case</strong></h3>
<p>
The data that expresses a case consists of patient descriptors, exposures (e.g.,
environmental or behavioral, past and current medications and procedures),
physiological and pathophysiological assessments and descriptions (e.g., labs,
vitals), clinical presentation and progression (e.g., signs, symptoms),
diagnostic evaluations and physical exam findings, family history and genetic
markers, past and current diagnoses, risk and severity scores, ultimate and
intermediate outcomes in response to treatment.  Relevant data elements may be
inferred from primitive data elements (e.g., BMI, eGFR, Seattle Heart Failure
Model) or may require clinical assessment and judgment using primitive data
elements (e.g., MELD Score, NYHA HF Class).  Medication and other substance
administrations can be considered exposures and orders without corresponding
events may be considered sufficient descriptions of the patient’s past and
current state of health and disease.
</p>
<p>
In the FHIR CPG, these descriptors of the patient, in the context of a case, are
referred to as CPG_CaseFeatures, whether they are primitive clinical data
elements (largely Clinical, Diagnostics, and Medications resources), or inferred
data elements from various

FIG XX.  The Case consist of all the patient descriptors including exposures
physiological and pathophysiological assessments and descriptions, clinical
presentation and progression, diagnostic evaluations and physical findings, past
and current diagnoses and procedures, related risk and severity scores, and
family history and genetic profile.

<p>
<strong>Case Features</strong>
</p>
<p>
The features of the case are the clinically meaningful and relevant data
elements or information that describe the current and relevant past state of the
patient that is pertinent to the scope of the guideline recommendations and
related decisions to be considered.  These typically describe the
clinicopathophysiology pertaining to the condition(s) and state of disease,
potential intervention(s), and contraindications  related to guideline
recommendations.  These may include patient presentation (e.g., symptoms),
clinical assessments and observations (e.g., physical findings, labs, vitals,
diagnostic results, -omic profiles), diagnoses (e.g., problems or conditions)
including temporally related risk and severity scores, exposures (e.g., various
current and prior interventions such as medications/substances and procedures),
family and travel history, as well as goals and preferences that may be relevant
to the scope of the guideline and information needs for related clinical
decision making and care processes.  Furthermore, case features that correlate
to complications of the known or suspected disease(s) as well as suspected or
potential side effects of the various interventions scoped to the guideline
should be considered.  Lastly, current and prior orders and prescriptions may be
considered as case features since they convey timing and intent of interventions
and may be the initial or only signal thereof.
</p>
<p>
Almost all primitive key features come from a subset of the FHIR Resources and
follow the event pattern.  The information from an event pattern (FHIR Event
pattern) describes an activity that has taken place or that is currently taking
place.
</p>
<p>
Case features in the CPG-IG are formalized and concretized as CPGCaseFeatures
that reference and/or profile numerous FHIR Resources from the healthcare
process domain (e.g., Clinical, Diagnostics, Medications). The CPGCaseFeature
definitions and expressions are often scoped to the overall CPGPathway and
organized as their own, specialized library as they are some of the most reused
components across various CPG assets and their expressions.  However, as many
CPGCaseFeatures may be used across multiple CPG’s, these expressions and/or the
assets containing them may be resolved by reference to a common, shared, and
well-controlled library of components (e.g., a knowledge base or “registry” of
features).
</p>
<p>
Many case features may require clinical judgment and/or assessment (including
impression) and therefore require real-time extraction or interaction with the
clinician user.  Such case features often necessitate clinician prompting and/or
documentation requirements to resolve and thus may be modeled as their own ECA
Rules (as part of the triggering, decision, or orchestration logic within
individual CPGRecommendations, CPGStrategies, and/or the CPGPathway) or as
adaptive forms (see Adaptive Questionnaire) scoped to the guideline element
where they are used.  Scoping of such required information must be done
carefully as to consider all guideline triggering, decision, and orchestration
logic that may depend on such information.  The knowledge engineer must also be
careful not to conflate description or evaluation logic (about the patient) with
formal logic for how to interact with the end-user (form logic) as described in
the section on Tiers of Functionality.  All clinical description logic about the
patient should be scoped to the case feature and then may be used by the
adaptive questionnaire.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Derived or Inferred Case Features</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Many case features must be derived or inferred computationally from other
data elements (i.e., case features) such as medical calculations (e.g., BMI,
eGFR, Anion Gap, hours since intervention, post-op hemoglobin drop), risk and
severity scores (MELD Score, Seattle Heart Failure Model, CHA2DS2-VASc score),
and case features requiring contextualization (e.g., pre-op hemoglobin,
discharge weight, admission blood pressure).  In the CPG-IG, these are referred
to as CPGDerivedCaseFeatures and their definitions and inferencing logic
expressions are typically contained within the same library as the rest of the
CPGCaseFeatures scoped to the specific CPG (i.e., guideline).  Of note, there is
often a “chaining” of inference where many derived case features
(CPGDerivedCaseFeatures) are actually dependent on other derived case features.
 For the knowledge engineer as well as for resolvability (i.e., computability),
it is important to have a means to denote these dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    Some case features are descriptions of physiological and/or
pathophysiological states of the patient that may need to be inferred from
primitive case features such as the various events described above.  For
instance, there may be a number of case features (i.e., events including
clinical impressions) that are required to assess a key physiological and/or
clinicopathological process (i.e., vendor forms critical decision-making)
respective to guideline recommendations. An example of this is volume status,
perfusion status, and hemodynamic status for various guideline recommendations
for inpatient chronic congestive heart failure.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    It is not uncommon for inferred case features and events to be used to
provide a decision aid to a clinician who then assesses this information and
documents their clinical impression (i.e., FHIR Resource ClinicalImpression)
recorded as an event and CPGCaseFeature itself.  In fact, this is the case in
the example above where the clinician makes the ultimate assessment of these
critical physiological/pathophysiological processes that inform key
decision-making in the clinical care scoped to such a CPG.  This pattern
combining primitive clinical information (i.e., events), inferences made upon
them (i.e., inferred case features), and requests for clinician documentation
manifested as a clinical impression often addressed using an Adaptive Form (see
FHIR Adaptive form,  the FHIR Questionnaire,  and QuestionnaireResponse
Resources).  These patterns are commonly used as part of the CPG.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Separating Patient Descriptive Logic from Clinical Decision
Logic</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An important note to the knowledge engineer to pay special attention to the
separation of decision logic about what to do for the patient from description
or inferencing logic that describes something about or the nature of the patient
(e.g. clinical pathological process, risk, severity, in qualifiers thereof).
This greatly simplifies the decision logic as well as makes the inferences about
the patient readily available for other logic and/or other use cases.  This
takes particular attention from the knowledge engineer to disambiguate the logic
that evaluates the state and/or condition of the patient (or qualifiers thereof)
from the logic that describes how a clinician reasons over what to do for the
patient.
</p>
<p>
    Several questions the knowledge engineer may ask themselves are: “describe
something about the patient?”, “does this qualify the patient’s historical,
present, or likely future clinical state or status?”, and “does this decision
logic focus on solely evaluating descriptive patient-level variables (as
CPGCaseFeatures) and describing what to do or not to do for the patient given
these conditions?”
</p>
<p>
<strong>Case Feature Groups</strong>
</p>
<p>
For numerous reasons, sets or groups of case features often need to be
considered together, including to present the dependencies (i.e., set of case
features) of derived case features or to denote case features that are relevant
or pertinent to a given recommendation or decision (i.e., supporting
information).  CPGCaseFeatureGroups are defined using the FHIR GraphDefinition
Resource and realized as a FHIR Composition Resource.  Furthermore, a case
feature group may have a particular semantic relevance within the guideline such
as a case feature or recommendation and may use the ?scoping_relationship of the
CPGCaseFeatureGroup profile to denote so.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Case Feature Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>
Many case features have special meaning when taken in the context of other case
features and/or other CPG semantics (e.g., recommendations).  This contextual
meaning may be conveyed through a semantic relationship between the case feature
and its contextualizing semantic (i.e., another case feature(s) or
recommendation(s)).  The CPGCaseFeature profile addresses this through an
attribute that includes both the reference to the other semantic(s) and the
explicit nature of the relationship (i.e., coded value).  As described above,
certain case features have particular relevance in the context of some medical
decision-making process or recommendation that is known in the healthcare domain
as pertinence.  In the CPG-IG, pertinence is an additional optional qualifier on
a given CPGCaseFeatureRelationship.  Pertinence may be positive or negative,
strong or weak, and/or pathognomonic.  Furthermore, pertinence may be static or
inferred through an expression.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Case Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
A summary of all the case features can provide a collection of all the
clinically meaningful data elements, both primitive and inferred, pertaining to
the full scope of a given CPG.  The CPGCaseSummary affords this collection and
is a specialization of a CPGCaseFeatureGroup. It may be composed by referencing
one or more CPGCaseFeatureGroups and one or more CPGCaseFeatures.
