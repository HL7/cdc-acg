<h2><strong>Guideline Development Frameworks </strong></h2>
<p>
The following frameworks are used in guideline development and across the
evidence ecosystem:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Knowledge Synthesis and the Evidence Pyramid</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge synthesis is the process in professional community of practice that
applies and develops methodologies for systematically evaluating a corpus of
evidence related to a particular condition or intervention.  This includes
deciding what evidence from across the evidence ecosystem to evaluate (<a
href="https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#Deciding">https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#Deciding</a>)
as well as various methods for performing this evaluation (<a
href="https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#Summarizingtable">https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#Summarizingtable</a>).
 One factor that is taken into consideration is the validity and/or quality of
evidence.  In evaluating the validity of evidence, one factor that is taken into
consideration is the Evidence Pyramid, discussed below.  The quality of evidence
may be systematically evaluated, often through knowledge synthesis methodologies
such as meta-analyses, systematic reviews, evidence summaries, or rapid reviews,
and applying frameworks such as GRADE, discussed further below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews (Syntheses):</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of
multiple quantitative studies (e.g. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT’s), cohort
studies) that address the same question, with each individual study reporting
individual study results that are expected to have some degree of error. The
objective is to use statistical approaches to derive a pooled estimate closest
to the ‘unknown truth’. Meta-analyses yield a weighted average of the results of
the individual studies and have the capacity to contrast the results from
different studies, identify patterns among study results or potential sources of
disagreement among those results, or other relationships that become evident in
the context of multiple studies. This approach of aggregating information leads
to a higher statistical power and more robust point estimate than is possible
from any individual study. (ref)
</p>
<p>
    A systematic review is a summary of the literature that uses a systematic
approach to identify and critically appraise publications or evidence from the
literature on a given topic.  Systematic reviews are intended to provide a
comprehensive and exhaustive summary of current evidence that is ”methodical,
comprehensive, transparent, and replicable.” (ref) systematic reviews may relate
to interventions (benefits and harms), use of diagnostic testing to detect a
particular disease, prognosis or probable course for future outcomes, risks of
developing a given condition, or even a systematic review of systematic reviews
to consolidate holistic evidence about a given topic (e.g. disease, procedure).

<p>
    The Evidence Pyramid refers to a means to evaluate the quality or validity
of evidence (higher toward the top) as well as provide a visual depiction of the
amount of evidence (width) (ref).  The evaluation of the evidence not only
informs the guideline development process and resulting recommendations but is
further communicated together with the recommendations themselves using the
GRADE framework, described below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>PICOTS Typology</strong>- Patient population, Intervention, Comparator,
Outcomes, Timing, Setting. The PICOTS Typology may be used for scoping the
guideline and individual recommendations and the analysis of the supporting
evidence or studies (e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and the individual
studies that serve as their body of evidence).  There are implications to
guideline eligibility, applicability criteria for individual recommendations
(the “condition” portion of ECA rules), and various data element and terminology
semantics across the CPG. (<a

<strong>GRADE (G</strong>rades of <strong>R</strong>ecommendation
<strong>A</strong>ssessment, <strong>D</strong>evelopment and
<strong>E</strong>valuation<strong>)</strong>- GRADE describes a process and a
structured framework for conveying information to develop a common, transparent,
and sensible system for grading the <strong>quality</strong> of evidence and the
<strong>strength</strong> of recommendations. Quality of evidence and strength
of recommendations have implications for not only recommendation metadata and
implementation approaches.  GRADE distinctly separates the evaluation of the
quality of evidence from the evaluation of strength of recommendations.  (<a
