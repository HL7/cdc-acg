<h3><strong>Care Plan</strong></h3>
<p>
A care plan can be conceptualized as the patient-specific or instantiated “plan”
concretized against an individual case.  The Care Plan describes the intention
of how one or more healthcare professionals intend to provide care for a
specific patient, group, or community for a period of time, possibly limited to
care for a specific condition or set of conditions.  In the CPG, the care plan
is scoped to the condition(s), intervention(s), recommendation(s), and other
relevant “plan” content in this limited context (e.g., contraindications,
correlated orders and results such as drug levels, or other orders or
fulfillments that must be considered in triggering, decision, or orchestration
logic).
</p>
<p>
The CPGCarePlan is constrained to the set of proposals (i.e., patient-specific
recommendations), clinical interventions (e.g., orders/ requests), or their
fulfillments (e.g., events) scoped by a specific CPG.  This includes those
related to the guideline recommendations, the strategies for combining guideline
recommendations, the decision logic for each recommendation, the strategies for
combining recommendations, and  how the overall guideline or pathway combines or
orchestrates all of the recommendations and strategies in the context of a
specific case (i.e., patient).  As described in the “Methodology” section, the
CPGCarePlan is modeled as a profile on a FHIR CarePlan Resource.

<li><strong>Proposal:</strong>
<p>
    A patient-specific recommendation, that has taken into account all the
criteria in the computable decision logic and affords the ability for a care
team member to make a request (order, prescription, schedule) is known as a
proposal.  Such a request may be “being considered for a plan”, planned,
proposed, requested, or performed within a clinical information system workflow,
further tracking of the state of completion of an activity may be supported
through the FHIR Task Resource.  “Being considered for a plan” means that the
activity or potential (see request pattern) has not yet been fully evaluated.
“Planned” means that the activity or request is intended but has not yet entered
the workflow.  “Proposed” means that the activity or request has been suggested
either by a decision support system or another care team member such as a
consulting physician.  “Requested” means that the activity or request has been
initiated by an authorized healthcare professional or care team member.
“Performed” means that the activity or request has reached a state of completion
resulting in an event (see Event pattern).  Proposals carry sufficient
information to initiate a request.

<p>
    <strong>CPGProposal as a Patient-specific CPGRecommendation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A CPGProposal is a patient-specific instantiation of a CPGRecommendation.
As such, a CPGProposal carries forward much of the information content of the
CPGRecommendation, including all of the necessary definition for the request
such as attributes or parameters that have been defined explicitly or inferred
through the various decision logic or other formal expressions of the
CPGRecommendation or broader CPG.  Furthermore, a CPGProposal may similarly
carry forward information specific to a CPGRecommendation, such as the narrative
guideline recommendation and its reference or provenance to through an Evidence
Resource, including directionality, strength of recommendation, and quality of
evidence qualifiers, which themselves reference Evidence Resources and Evidence
Variables.  Of note, information contained in evidence variables, such as
formalizations of various PICOTS variables (i.e., population, intervention,
comparator, outcomes, timing, and setting) may not only be used in the
CPGRecommendation (i.e., semantics of request definition and decision logic),
but may be used in end-user enablements (e.g., SMART-on-FHIR apps) to facilitate
additional capabilities such as retrieving and displaying supplemental patient
data (e.g., summary views) or for population-level aggregates for comparison
(e.g., “patient-like-this” queries).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Patient Information Supporting the Proposal</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Patient-specific recommendations or proposals, and clinical decision support
in general, have been shown to be more effective and beneficial when supported
by recommendations-specific patient information.  In the 6S evidence pyramid
described in the “Guideline Development Process” section, this is referred to as
real-world evidence.  This patient-specific information often includes the
pertinent information from the case that informs the decision(s) that the
clinician must make with respect to the recommendation (e.g., representing
indications for an intervention). This often includes the primitive and inferred
data elements used in the decision logic for the recommendation.  It may address
contextual historical information and clinical information related to the
clinical and disease processes (i.e., clinicopathology directly related to the
medical decision(s)) implicit in the recommendation and made explicit by the
knowledge formalizations. It may also include pertinent information related to
contraindications (i.e., reasons not to perform the recommended intervention),
that are both relative and absolute, though most absolute contraindications are
addressed directly in the formalized decision logic.
</p>
<p>
    In the CPG, this supporting information is closely correlated with the
CPGCaseFeatures used in the formalized decision logic for the CPGRecommendation,
or some subset thereof, as well as other data elements may have been specified
as required in the CPGRecommendation (i.e., as a scoped CPGCaseFeatureGroup or
CPGCasePlanSummaryView).  These additional data elements (CPGCaseFeatures) may
represent relevant historical or contextualizing information, the status or
responses (CPGRequest, CPGEvents) of related CPGProposals, or even other
CPGRecommendations not yet proposed, as well as relative or absolute
contraindications for the CPGProposal.  In order to specify this information, a
CPGRecommendation may include scoped definitions of CPGCaseFeatureGroups or
CPGCasePlanSummaryViews.

<li><strong>Request</strong>
<p>
    The notion of "request" encompasses all types of orders (e.g., original
orders, filler representations of orders, reflex orders, etc.) as well as
proposals/recommendations for action to occur, plans, scheduling, etc. Any sort
of description of an activity that is desired where the description is specific
to the subject of the activity and the approximate timing of the activity would
be considered a request.  (see FHIR Request Pattern).  In the CPG-IG, a request
may be the result of a proposal or may at least correlate to the proposed
request; however, there may be other requests of interest to the scope of a
specific CPG, in particular a CPGStrategy and/or CPGRecommendation, CPGCarePlan,
 CPGCasePlanSummaryView,  CPGCaseSummary, or any of the numerous derived assets
such as the CPGMetric, CPGMeasure, CPGeCaseReport, or
CPGCasePlanProgressingNote.
</p>
<p>
    Of note, a request is at the boundary between the care plan and the case
(i.e., CPGCarePlan, CPGCase).  While an order may not necessarily represent
something that was actually done to the patient (e.g., a medication
administration as an ‘exposure’), there are several reasons to consider it as
part of the case (i.e., patient specific information) as well as the care plan.
First of all, it is not uncommon for an order or prescription (i.e., request) to
be the only evidence that something was done for the patient without any data
element in the clinical information system (e.g., EHR) that represents or
documents the resulting event.  Secondly, requests (e.g., orders, prescriptions,
scheduling services) conveys strong intent and timing information about the
patient’s clinical state and/or interventions.  The approach the CPG-IG takes in
addressing requests is to consider them as both part of the CPGCarePlan as well
as a CPGCaseFeature- it plays dual roles and is referenced by each.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Event</strong>
<p>
    An event is a description of an activity that has taken place or that is
currently taking place. It includes resources that primarily describe the result
of a request (e.g., activity) or what was found (e.g., a condition or
observation). Examples include medication dispense or administrations,
procedures, encounters, questionnaire responses, observations, diagnostic
report, clinical document (i.e., FHIR Composition), and many other found in the
FHIR Event pattern.
</p>
<p>
    Similar to a request, an event also may be at the boundary between the care
plan in the case (i.e., CPGCarePlan, CPGCase).  However, only events that
correspond to the fulfillment of a request belong in the care plan.  These
Events also serve as CPGCaseFeatures in the CPGCase. Boundary issues for dealing
with events that belong to both the CPGCarePlan and CPGCase are discussed in the
section on Separating and Defining Case, Plan, and Workflow.
