# Mechanisms of Integration

Broadly speaking, there are two main mechanisms for integrating computable guideline content:

* Content import: Importing/ingestion by a system capable of interpreting the content
* Content service: Integration as a service

## Content Import

## Service Integration

## Hybrid

Just as there are various enablements (or delivery vectors) for computable content, there are variations on the integration themes above, including of course the use of different mechanisms together. For example, a system may implement partial ingestion of content, and use a service to cover gaps, or a system may use ingestion for some recommendations, but a service for others.
