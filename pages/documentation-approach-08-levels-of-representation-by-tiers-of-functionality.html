<h1>Levels of Representation by Tiers of Functionality</h1>
<p>
A basic approach that may help with addressing appropriate separations of
concerns is to consider where certain knowledge engineering artifacts may be
situated when considering both tears of functionality and levels of
representation as shown in the table below.

    FIG XX. Levels of Representation by Tiers of Functionality with Examples
</p>
<p>
Across the top are levels of knowledge representation, from narrative text L1
(Level 1), through successively more structured representations, ending with
running, executable software at the right L4 (Level 4). At the bottom of the
diagram, the <em>data</em> tier (T1) represents the concepts and data elements
within the guideline. Above that, the <em>logic</em> tier (T2) represents the
business and process rules of the guideline, and at the top, the <em>forms</em>
or <em>user-interface</em> tier (T3) represents the user interactions with the
guideline content.  Refer to Tiers of Functionality and Levels of
Representation.
</p>
<p>
Note that the levels of knowledge representation are a continuum, with discrete
categories introduced in the methodology to help inform discussions and
communicate the concepts involved. Typically, the initial guideline content is
published in narrative form (L1), but guidelines will often contain diagrams,
charts, and other depictions that lean towards semi-structured (L2)
representation.
