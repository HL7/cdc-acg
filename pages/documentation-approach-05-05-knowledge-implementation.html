<h3><strong>Knowledge Implementation:</strong></h3>
<p>
Knowledge implementation refers to the activities of localizing the knowledge
formalisms, including addressing data bindings (e.g., data and terminology
mappings), workflow insertions and localization factors (e.g., adjustments to
thresholds), integration to end-user system endpoint interfaces, and adjustment
or issues related to data quality, timing, enrichment, and/or required data
enrichments.  At minimum, there is a local data, clinical logic, and workflow
validation step prior to full implementation.
</p>
<p>
While local implementations of guideline recommendations may warrant their own
implementation guide, this implementation guide addresses several critical
factors and considerations related to local implementation.  Native EHR build is
out of scope.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Local Content and Practice Governance:</strong>
</p>
<p>
First of all, many larger health care delivery organizations have practice
governance oversight bodies that may function in some degree like a guideline
development group utilizing local organizational experts and key stakeholders,
inputs from their own quality functions and research apparatus, and taking into
account organizational goals, objectives, and limitations.  This practice
governance group often takes into account one or more recognized expert
body-developed guidelines (as described in the “Guideline Development Process”
section), contextualized to a common set of clinical practices and/or common
clinical workflows and aligned to organizational goals, issues, and processes.
</p>
<p>
Local practice governance and quality functions use their own local clinical
registries (also called data marts) to analyze their patient population(s) and
align their characteristics with guideline recommendations.  These local
registries or data marts may be used to test hypotheses formulated by the
practice governance group, in part using guideline recommendations and their
measures with their own experts’ and frontline staff’s input.  This may result
in varying degrees of adaptations to the guideline recommendations including
changes to thresholds or parameters, goals for plans or interventions, workflow
insertions, and/or adding or removing recommendations.  Many of the various
feedback mechanisms in the CPG (e.g., metrics, measures, eCaseReports for
registries, etc.) may be used similarly by the practice governance group.

<p>
<strong>Local informatics (knowledge engineering) and implementation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Just as many of the functions and methods of the guideline development group
have their local analogues, so does the knowledge engineering and guideline
formalization and implementation.
</p>
<p>
Local implementation of standardize best practices includes workflow and
decision support (e.g. order sets, documentation templates or adaptive forms,
reminders of various types, summary views and clinical dashboards, data
enrichments), quality measurement and monitoring, and data collection for
analytics (e.g. local clinical registries or data marts).  Native EHR build,
clinical information systems, and other local vendor implementations are out of
scope for this implementation guide.
</p>
<p>
However, many of the activities that the informatics team performs quite
analogous to the knowledge engineering function including: identifying and or
defining local data definitions, terminologies, and their respective sources;
helping to elicit and specify clinical business logic; eliciting and specifying
critical performance metrics (may be clinical, operational, and/or financial);
translating all business logic specifications (into local application build
environments or similar vendor capabilities); validating business logic (as
implemented in local systems, often considered ‘clinical validation’ as done to
check for clinical validity); as well as maintaining and improving the above as
needed.
</p>
<p>
Much of the business logic, as specified, is nearly identical, or otherwise
substantially related (could be derived from the standard CPG).  This often
holds true for the clinical business logic (clinical decision-logic for
recommendations), abstract key considerations for workflow insertions (e.g. EHR
“chart events”, see CDSHooks).  Furthermore, many of the clinical and/or
operational performance metrics are analogous or very related to many of the
CPGMetrics and CPGMeasures.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, many of the data definitions and terminologies are the same or very
related, and could be significantly informed by those in the standard CPG.  This
includes primitive (data requirements) and inferred data elements for local
clinical registries or data marks are very similar to the CPGCaseFeatures.
</p>
<p>
Some activities unique to local informatics and implementation includes:
capturing, analyzing, and optimizing local clinical workflows; redesigning and
integrating new end-user application capabilities together with local clinical
workflows and business processes; performing end-user or workflow validation
(may be in a simulation environment, limited release- only specified users, or
pilot release); issues related to periodic upgrades of vendor software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concurrent Development and Implementation</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Given the similarities between and related activities of the CPG development
process and the local implementation of standardized best practices, there are
considerable opportunities for improving the effectiveness, efficiency,
implementability, and overall uptake (and enhancement) guideline recommendations
related best practices.
</p>
<p>
One of the opportunities with the CPG-IG is to move as much work as possible
upstream, tightly integrated with the guideline development process to
significantly reduce the amount of rework and potential error introduced when
this work must be repeated for each and every implementation at each and every
local site.  Furthermore, with the use of standards for representations,
expressions, and other formalizations (including delivery mechanisms), the
CPG-IG promotes holds the potential for much reuse, either directly as content
or through shared services (e.g., CDS, eCQM aaS, SMART-on-FHIR apps, etc.), as
an explicit specification for local build environments, or as starting point for
localization of CPG content with the similar re-use across layers of knowledge
representations, tiers of functionality, implementation methods, and/or delivery
and integration mechanisms.

    <strong>Analogs and Collaboration across CPG Development and
Implementation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As described in the section on Knowledge Implementation, there are numerous
analogues between the guideline development group and local practice governance
as well as between the CPG knowledge engineering function and local informatics
and EHR build functions.  Likewise, as the guideline development group and
knowledge engineering function collaborate in the CPG development process, so
does the local practice governance and informatics/EHR build function in the
local knowledge implementation process.  The similarities in or complementation
of functions and tasks, content and information, expertise and skills, and goals
and objectives affords a significant opportunity to collaborate more closely, to
share related or derivative assets, and to more effectively, efficiently, and
rapidly implement best occurrences and achieve objectives.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Feedback- early, often, actionable:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, such a collaboration provides an opportunity to engage and
address critical implementation concerns further upstream as well as afford
earlier, shorter, and actionable feedback loops into the overall best practice
to daily practice endeavor.  These feedback loops may be through direct
interaction between the various functions, through the use of real-world data
early in the CPG development process, and through constrained, limited-scope,
and focused full lifecycle iterations.
</p>
<p>
For instance, as data elements and terminologies start could be defined
relatively early in the collaborative CPG development process, they may be
assessed or even obtained (e.g de-identified data sets from data marts or local
clinical registries).  In part, this enables a feasibility assessment on
required data elements, and may further provide a real-world data substrate for
the knowledge engineering lifecycle process for a CPG.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Real-world Data to Develop CPGs:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Such real-world data can not improve the quality (effectiveness and implementability) of the CPG, it affords the opportunity to greatly accelerate the knowledge engineering process and overall CPG development lifecycle by:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifying and informing knowledge acquisition
<li>Providing representative samples or cohorts even prior to translation or specification
<li>Greatly reducing the work of test case creation; providing representative, broad coverage, near gold standard test cases for test-driven development (logic formalization, expression)
<li>Concurrent validation of business logic for the CPD development process and local knowledge implementations
<li>Making earlier, shorter, constrained chunking and rapid feedback loops much more feasible and valuable
<li>Not only providing feedback on the knowledge engineering through implementation processes, but to the guideline development and practice governance groups on the recommendations themselves.  In fact, in situations where the evidence quality or level may be low, especially where there may be conflicting or even unknown recommendations, such constrained short-cycle feedback loops can even serve to inform the recommendations themselves (e.g.
especially when there are multiple local implementers that can provide sufficient statistical power to inform or even improve the evidence itself). Such feedback does require additional expertise from the evidence ecosystem
(e.g. clinical researchers) and/or knowledge discovery/ data sciences community as part of and/or in concert with the guideline development group.
<li>By delivering early, often, and much needed “wins” from feedback and
improvement on key aspects of the CPG (as well as local implementation or even
practice).
<p>
Obviously, having more than one local implementation affords many benefits
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposing more representative variation in data, local practices, and implementation(s) and their respective environments
<li>Providing more representative data for knowledge engineering processes
<li>Providing a larger sample size for evidence-level feedback on recommendations
<li>Potentially providing more substantive “wins”
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

FIG XX. Knowledge Implementation concurrent with Agile CPG Development has the potential to eliminate much waste, increase time-to-use/utility, create more feedback loops earlier in the process, improve the overall value of the guideline, and close the loop in forming a Learning Health System.  Such an approach may be even more critical in the case of a pandemic with a novel contagion with an atypical pathophysiological response where best practices and evidence are unknown or yet to be discovered.
</p>
<p>
Concurrent development and implementation of CPG’s has significant alignment and synergy with the Agile CPG Development Approach, though it provides further opportunities and capabilities to make the approach even more Agile as described above.
</p>
<p>
Further details of knowledge implementation are beyond the scope of this
document at this time, but have implications partially addressed in the section
on “Methods of Implementation.”
