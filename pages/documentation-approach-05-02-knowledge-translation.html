<h3><strong>Knowledge Translation</strong></h3>
<p>
Knowledge translation has specific meaning within the knowledge engineering
lifecycle process for knowledge engineers.  However, there are at least three
perspectives on knowledge translation that must be considered in the context of
co-developing a clinical guideline together with its formal representation as a
CPG.  These include:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The “activities involved in moving research from the laboratory, the
research journal, and the academic conference into the hands of people and
organizations who can put it to practical use” (ref)
<li>The translation between and across various levels of knowledge
representation,  from narrative to semi-structured to structured to executable
(described in detail below in “Knowledge Representation” section).
<li>The translation between equivalent or iso-pragmatic knowledge formalisms
(i.e., representations, expressions) such as is done with concept maps between
terminologies or as will be discussed further in the “Methodology” section (see
BPM+ -to- CPG).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The broader perspective on clinical knowledge translation across the entire
knowledge ecosystem provides perspective on various sources of knowledge and the
nature of their content and metadata.  The translation between and across levels
of knowledge representation is a well-established activity for the knowledge
engineer as is translation between formalisms. Knowledge engineers have tooling
and techniques to address these activities, and some even take into
consideration their respective touch points across the broader knowledge
ecosystem. However, there are ongoing efforts, tool development activities, and
knowledge resources across the knowledge ecosystem that may provide additional
benefits in efficiency, timeliness, and effort that may be taken into
consideration when developing a CPG.
