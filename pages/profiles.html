From Danny van Leeuwen to Everyone:  02:57 PM
Fascinating conversation reflecting the inherent conundrum of data folks trying to marry black and white thinking (code) with soft real-life decision-making and action. Care plans are maps for clinicians and patients to take as they try to meet a clinical or personal goal. Strength of evidence is a piece, only a piece. But knowing the care plan steps agreed upon and tracking that activity is critical to attaining the clinical and life goals.

You may want to speak with Ralph Brindis at ACC about this he can help sort out.



Strength of Recommendation, Quality of Evidence, Certainty of Benefit



    Plan
        Recommendations (the activity the guidelines tell you to do or not to do)
        Strategies (organize or orchestrate recommendations)
        Pathways (Eligibility, Enrollment)
    Case
        Case Features (describe some aspect of a patient)
    Care Plan
        Proposals (patient-specific recommendations)
        Requests (the orders or activities resulting or related to the proposal)
        Events (resulting or related to the request and/or proposal)
    Workflow and Common Pathway
    Related or Derived Assets
        Guideline (container for all CPG assets)
        Metrics (patient-level indicator of compliance, adherence, and end- and intermediate-outcomes related to guideline-directed care)
        Measures (population-level compliance, adherence, and end- and intermediate-outcomes related to guideline-directed care; uses Measure-IG)
        CaseSummary (roll-up of all the case features)
        CasePlanSummaryView (roll-up of case features and care plan with respect to some scope)
        CasePlanProgressingNote (roll-up of case features, care plan, and clinical impressions with respect to a point in time or event)
        eCaseReport (any data from the CPG relevant to the reporting body; uses eCaseReport-IG)
