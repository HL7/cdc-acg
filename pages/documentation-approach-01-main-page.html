<h1><strong>Clinical Practice Guidelines - Approach</strong></h1>
<p>
The approach section to this implementation guide describes how a guideline developers, informaticians (knowledge engineers and others), and implementers of computable representations of guidelines can collaborate across the lifecycle of guideline-directed care and related activities (clinical decision support, quality measurement, case reporting, continuous improvement), leveraging existing standards-based approaches.

<h1><strong>Executive Summary for CPG Approach</strong></h1>

<p>
Translating guideline recommendations and other types of guidance into practice has historically been a site by site exercise that has been disconnected from guideline/guidance development, creating unnecessary redundancies and introducing potential errors in translation that can lead to inconsistencies in how the guideline or guidance is executed. This clinical practice guidelines implementation guide (CPG-IG) consists of standards and a standardized, scalable approach to help make the effort of translating and implementing clinical practice guidelines and other types of guidance more efficient and effective. Key aspects include:
</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/CPG-Main-06.png" width="700" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">
</p><p><em>FIG 01. Clinical Quality Lifecycle</em> with situated standards to address each respective phase.  The CPG-IG addresses a critical gap in explicitly formalizing the guideline recommendations and other guideline features as computer-interpretable for downstream consumption and closing the feedback as well as feedforward loop(s).</p>

<ol>

<li>An integrated guideline/guidance development and implementation process (referred to as “the integrated process”)

<li>Common standards that can work across the entire data lifecycle (a.k.a. learning health system - see figure X) and different electronic health record (EHR) platforms

<li>Closed-loop guideline content and information flow inclusive of feedback and feedforward processes
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="assets/images/delivering-actionable-knowledge.png" width="700" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></p>
<p><em>Figure 02. The data lifecycle</em> and impacts to the public’s health (Michaels,M, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).  An updated version of this lifecycle directly related to the processes, approaches, and computable artifacts discussed in this section is shown below.</p>
<p>
The integrated process (see figure Y) brings downstream implementation considerations and stakeholders into the upstream guideline/guidance development process by incorporating parallel and iterative development of tools (e.g., clinical decision support (CDS) or electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs)) as the guideline/guidance is being developed. This includes gathering input from implementers (e.g., from the clinical and informatics perspectives at clinical sites) on feasibility and validity. This is done by incorporating implementers, knowledge engineers, and other downstream perspectives into the guideline development process to produce computer-interpretable artifacts that express the narrative guideline, delivering them as a “package”. Many downstream implementers can then consume and implement those standards-based artifacts without significant rework.
</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/CPG-Main-RedesigningGuidelineDevelopment.png" width="" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></p>
<p><em>FIG. 3. Redesigning guideline development and implementation:</em> The Integrated Process (Michaels, M, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). NOTE: The “Implementation” perspective represents local implementers that are part of the concurrent guideline development and translation part of the process, and “Local Implementation” represents the actual implementation at clinical sites once the guidelines and related CDS, are published.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the translation into tools like CDS and eCQMs applies common health IT standards like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL). How to use these standards to develop shareable, platform-independent tools based on guidelines/guidance for a variety of diseases, conditions, or preventive care is the primary focus of this CPG-IG, including this Approach section. Secondarily, this CPG-IG shows how using FHIR can help with other data-focused activities, such as public health reporting (i.e., using electronic case reports) or quality reporting (i.e., using eCQMs), that provide a feedback loop that feeds the evidence. The evidence can also be represented using FHIR (i.e., EBM-on-FHIR) and could be applied in summarizing evidence and updating guidelines/guidance. This completes the “data lifecycle” that allows for continuous learning and improvement - a “learning health system”.  The CPG-IG approach can be a key component of a learning health system in times requiring rapid response, where knowledge of best practice is not well-known.
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Introduction and Rationale</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>The purpose of the CPG-IG is to:</strong>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Enable computable guideline specification to occur concurrently with guideline development;</li>

<li>Faithfully express guideline intent, including rationale and linkage to evidence-base;</li>

<li>Enable efficient and effective use and reuse of the guideline specification in downstream capabilities;</li>

<li>Accelerate the development of computable guideline specifications and interventions through an integrated, cross-functional, rapid-cycle (Agile) development process that is inclusive of local implementation processes;</li>

<li>More closely tie guideline intent, interventions, and measurements; and</li>

<li>Provide closed-loop (feedback and feed-forward loops) across the knowledge, practice, and discovery or evidence ecosystems.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Notes to Target Audiences:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The CPG Approach section highlights:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Various highly specialized and technical participants in the “Knowledge-to-Delivery-to-Discovery” ecosystem that often interact with each other’s work products but may not interact directly with each other;

<li>How the HL7 CPG-IG recognizes their distinct and valuable work and provides numerous opportunities to reuse domain standards (e.g., FHIR and other HL7 IG’s); and

<li>A reconceptualization of work processes that share and reuse essential information and content.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Much of this work has been informed by several international efforts, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age initiative (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ddphss/clinical-guidelines/index.html">ref</a>), the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Antenatal Care Guidelines (<a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/anc-positive-pregnancy-experience/en/">ref</a>), the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Working Group, and numerous other publicly funded and private sector initiatives including local health system implementations of guidelines and in-workflow pathways.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To the Guideline Developer: </strong>Working in parallel with knowledge engineers and other downstream consumers (e.g., local implementers) can identify areas within the guideline that need clarification, helping improve the narrative, provide opportunity to review the translation of the tools for fidelity to the guideline, and get early feedback from end-consumers of the guideline work product -- all <em>before</em> the guidelines or tools are published.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To the Knowledge Engineer:</strong> Working in parallel with guideline developers allows validation of translations directly with the “source of truth,” helping ensure accuracy. Working in parallel with downstream consumers (e.g., local implementers) provides the ability to confirm feasibility and validity for the users of the artifacts as they are produced by knowledge engineers and may even provide a useful means to build and validate once against real-world data and implementations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To the Downstream Consumers:</strong> Being involved with the guideline development and knowledge engineering process can help identify issues early in the process and optimize incorporation of the knowledge into downstream products that aid in implementation, such as apps, measures, or other point-of-care tools, and significantly reduce the rework of re-engineering parts of the guideline saving time and effort.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To the Local Implementer:</strong> The main goal of the knowledge developed is to implement it in practice. Having local implementers (both clinicians and informaticians) involved with the guideline development and knowledge engineering process allows for the ability to communicate anticipated issues for implementation so that guideline developers or knowledge engineers have the opportunity to adjust their respective products in order to help optimize the ease and positive impact of implementation.  A computable guideline representation can significantly reduce rework, saving time and effort for local implementations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>To the Knowledge Ecosystem:</strong> Taking a holistic approach to guideline development and implementation includes considerations for learning and continuous improvement through feedback and feedforward loops. A number of activities in the knowledge ecosystem that serve specific functions (e.g., case reporting to public health, quality reporting to payers, quality/data reporting to medical society registries, etc.) could also help provide the evidence that can inform updates to the guidelines/guidance. This evidence may be based on patient-level, point-of-care guideline usage, and detailed tracking thereof, affording new means of collecting evidence.
</p>
<p>
Using approaches, standards, and techniques addressed in further detail in individual sections, the CPG-on-FHIR as described in this implementation guide can serve a critical role in the full data lifecycle of a Learning Health System.

<p><em>Figure 4.<strong>Data Lifecycle Revisited in context of the CPG-IG:</strong></em>  With the guideline development group, the knowledge engineering team, and local implementation teams (practice governance and informatics/ EHR build) working collaboratively to develop and implement a CPG based on widely adopted standards (e.g., FHIR, CQL), there exists a synergy that can produce all the knowledge products more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Objectives</strong></li>
<li><strong>Direct:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduce duplicate development effort involved in the implementation of clinical practice guideline recommendations in clinical systems and accelerate time to broad delivery of best practices</li>
<li>Reduce unnecessary and/or unintentional variability in clinical practice guideline implementation</li>
<li>Reduce information loss and unnecessary rework in downstream implementation and related knowledge ecosystem activities that build on the guideline recommendations</li>
<li>Pull forward point-of-use considerations (e.g., usability, explicit intent) while reducing ambiguity of the recommendations that often must be addressed in downstream translation activities
<ul>
<li><strong>Indirect:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Minimize the time needed to implement clinical practice guideline recommendations in clinical systems</li>
<li>Reduce the rework for downstream derivative works such as decision support capabilities, guideline compliance (quality measures), feedback loops (case reports), and documentation requirements</li>
<li>Accelerate the learnings from guideline-directed care by closing feedback/feedforward loops</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The primary objective of the CPG approach to codifying clinical practice guidelines is to accelerate the translation and delivery of expert body evidence-based and best practice recommendations to the point of care. The CPG-IG was developed through multi-stakeholder engagement (e.g., guideline developers, knowledge engineers, clinical implementers, standards experts, patient and caregiver advocates, governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and others) to evolve the development approach and means of expressing clinical practice guidelines in computable formats.  These stakeholders identified the need to concurrently develop computable formats along with the narrative guidelines/guidance. As such, the knowledge engineering process, inclusive of elicitation, translation, specification, and formal representation, must be integrated with the guideline development process and serve the function of translating between the clinical domain and the formal, computable expressions thereof.  It is the intent of this section to describe some of the fundamentals of these activities as well as the concept, means, and performances to carry out this activity.
</p>
<p>
Secondarily, we describe how these activities interact with adjacent and related activities as well as content and related standards in the broader knowledge ecosystem (inclusive of evidence ecosystem, guideline developers, guideline-directed care, quality measure ecosystem, registry community, etc.). This includes upstream activities such as evidence generation and knowledge discovery as well as downstream activities such decision support (i.e., CDS), patient care, advanced cognitive support (e.g., using SMART-on-FHIR apps), quality measurement and reporting, and electronic case reporting (for similarly scoped conditions). All can serve to inform subsequent iterations of clinical guidelines and guideline-directed care and thus have a key role in the learning health system.
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Conformance and Levels of Enablement</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Trade-offs between effort, time to develop, and capabilities enabled (and value that can be derived) when developing a CPG.  From very basic context for narrative snippets searchable in a library (or Infobutton from EHR) to full clinical workflow enablement, cognitive support, and pathway tracking (likely via SMART-on-FHIR App or deep EHR integration) as well as feedback loops with real-world evidence of actual guideline usage, measures, etc. and as substrate for evidence ecosystem and/or feedforward loop for evidence updates.  Fortunately, the CPG-IG includes levels of enablement that correlate to work effort, time to delivery, as well as capabilities that it can support as well as the means to iteratively, and successively develop CPG versions that provide incremental value by ascending these levels of enablement.
</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>Guideline Development Process</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Guideline development involves systematic review of evidence related to specific clinical question(s) and then producing a set of recommendations and supporting information.  This implementation guide provides sufficient context for developing a computer-interpretable representation of the final work product of the guideline development process.
