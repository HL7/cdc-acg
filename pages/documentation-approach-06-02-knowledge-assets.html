<strong>Knowledge Assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge assets or artifacts as they are often referred to in FHIR, where an
artifact is an instance of an asset.  Assets provide the ability to keep domain
logic separated and distinct from other system logic in complex systems.  In
this implementation guide we often refer to knowledge assets and knowledge
artifacts interchangeably, though the distinction is very relevant the knowledge
engineer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset Metamodel- its structure- requirements and constraints
<li>Content- what goes into the asset “container”
<li>Metadata- see section below
<li>Composite and Derived- see below
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Asset Metamodel</strong>
</p>
<p>
The asset meta-model is a model that essentially describes what is required
and/or allowed for a given class of knowledge assets.  This includes its
‘schema’ (e.g attributes, cardinality), the scope or range of values allow for
given attributes, expressions or other formalisms allowed to be used with an
asset class, required and optional metadata (often using a metadata metamodel).
In FHIR, the means of defining asset metamodels is the FHIR StructureDefinition
Resource (though it is also used for definitions of resources other than
knowledge assets including all request (e.g. orders) and event (e.g. clinical
data element) resources).  Furthermore, the PlanDefinition Resource (based on
the HL-7 Knowledge Artifact Specification) is a base, or more generic, asset
meta-model definition that may be profiled using StructureDefinition to further
define additional asset meta-models.  The FHIR Library Resource and
GraphDefinition Resource are additional FHIR resources used in this limitation
guide as definitional resources for accept meta-models.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Content</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge asset content refers to that which is contained within a specific
knowledge asset.  This includes the scoped values or expressions for a specific
asset’s metadata, attributes, and other formalisms used to express the knowledge
contained within the asset.  The content must adhere to the rules and
constraints imparted by a given asset’s meta-model.  Content is what gives a
specific asset its meaning, function or behavior, and enables it to perform its
intent when reasoned over at ‘run-time’.  Metadata about the content may be
derived or asserted (e.g. annotated through human or machine processes).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Asset Metadata</strong>
</p>
<p>
Metadata is data that provides information about the knowledge asset.  This may
include disk active metadata, structural metadata, administrative metadata, and
situating or relational metadata.  Descriptive metadata provides information
about the nature of the knowledge asset as well as information about the nature
of the content of an individual knowledge asset.  Structural metadata provide
information about the representation(s) and/or formalism(s) used in the
knowledge asset (e.g. the metamodel used for the asset and how it was applied
for this specific asset).  Administrative metadata is information that helps
manage the knowledge asset and is inclusive of knowledge engineering lifecycle,
governance, and authorization or rights metadata.  Situational or relational
metadata describes an assets relationship to other assets as well as the
totality of its relationships within the knowledge base.  Metadata may be
further broken down to the following category:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity and Versioning</strong> - used for distinct or unique
existence (identity), currency, change control, tagging to business usage
<li><strong>Classification and Organization</strong> - inferred and asserted
descriptors (asset type and subtypes, nature of expression, content type/
subtype, or other classification by any set of attributes).  Classification may
use and refer to both descriptive as well as structural metadata.
<li><strong>KM Lifecycle and Knowledge Engineering</strong> - status in asset
lifecycle (e.g., draft, final, deprecated), phase in knowledge engineering
workflow (may be localized and asset-specific)
<li><strong>Administrative</strong>- availability (use, subscription),
governance (who has signed off, stewardship- local and regulatory)
<li><strong>Authorization, Ownership, &amp; Rights</strong> - who “owns” and is
allowed to use the asset, access control metadata (used by permissioning rules),
legal status
<li><strong>Content</strong>- key concepts contained within and their roles
(e.g., Amoxicillin as treatment vs contraindication; nephropathy as a primary
condition vs complication).  Metadata on subject, topic, and setting may be
considered further content metadata that are either asserted or derived from the
asset itself (using ontologies within the knowledge base).
<li><strong>Provenance*</strong> - refers to the lineage of an asset (from what
other asset or process it was derived), including its full pedigree if it is or
was derived from a composite asset; and is inclusive of  authorship (who created
it)
<li><strong>Business Motivation</strong> - goals, objectives
<li><strong>Usage Context</strong> - where the asset was intended to be used
when it was created as well as where the asset is actually being used.
<li><strong>Relatedness</strong>- what other assets Use or are usedBy 'this'
asset (may be derived and/or asserted), what assets Contain or are containedBy
another asset, what assets are in lineage (derivedFrom: parent and
hasDerivative: copies/ clones), what assets share lineage or dependencies
(isRelatedto: "siblings" or "cousins"), what assets have shared usage context
(usedLike: ), what assets might be same/ similar (this is a more advanced use
case for an advance KM system that evaluates content/ expression, objective,
results;  relationships look like: equalTo, equivalentTo, expresses)
<ul>
<li>*Note: Provenance not only pertains to the linage and pedigree of knowledge
assets, but likewise to the data used by these assets in the inferred
information that results from the combination of the two.  This data provenance
is of critical value in knowledge driven systems and can be leveraged for
numerous features across the data and knowledge lifecycles.  Some of these
capabilities are described further in the Knowledge Engineering section.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In FHIR, asset metadata is addressed in several ways.  First, the FHIR
Resources, particularly those that are definitional(e.g., plan definition,
activity definition, measure definition, questionnaire) to be used as asset
“containers” have their own metadata attributes as defined with each resource.
Furthermore, shared metadata elements in FHIR Resources are described <a
href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html">https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resource.html</a>
and more detailed information about FHIR Metadata may be found (ref), or here
(ref).
</p>
<p>
Metadata may the semantic, using coded concepts in terminologies and ontologies
in order to facilitate numerous functions across the knowledge engineering
lifecycle and within a knowledge content management system.  Similarly values
for metadata may be references to other knowledge assets and or their attributes
(including their metadata).
</p>
<p>
To ensure integrity across all knowledge assets in a knowledge content
management system, an asset’s definition (metamodel) often references a common,
shared asset metadata meta-model (definition of the metadata that may or must be
used across all assets in a common knowledge base).  Additional information
about and approaches to metadata are described by the Mobilizing Computable
Biomedical Knowledge (MCBK) (ref, ref) and OMG (ref)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Expressions (and/or Languages)</strong>
</p>
<p>
An expression is a computable language for creating a computer-interpretable
representation of specific knowledge.  In HL-7 and for the scope of this
implementation guide, the expression language used (where its able to
sufficiently express the intended logic behavior) is the Clinical Quality
Language (CQL).  CQL further has performances for referencing additional
languages (e.g. Java, C#, or Python) akin to remote procedure calls, as well as
callouts to services where the needs to express computable logic exceed the
limits of CQL.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Declarations</strong>
</p>
<p>
A declaration is an expression of the structural elements of computable logic
(e.g. values for attributes and parameters of a knowledge asset) that does not
describe how to compute the logic, rather what the logic is.  Declarations
express the logic of a computation without describing its control flow (ref).
These declarations may then reference and/or be referenced by expressions as
described above.  The PlanDefinition Resource is a declarative knowledge asset
definition in HL-7 FHIR whose meta-model affords the means to reference and or
be referenced by CQL or other expression languages.  A specific PlanDefinition
is a declarative knowledge asset.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Composite Assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
No single representation or expression can sufficiently and/or appropriately
describe the nature and behavior of many domain concepts using computable
formalism.  Furthermore, many domain concepts build on and/or reference one
another.  To address these issues as well as some issues related to scalability
and reusability or shareability, many knowledge assets are actually comprised of
or composed using other knowledge assets.  A CPGPathway, CPGStrategy, and
CPGRecommendation are examples of composite asset in this implementation guide.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Derived Assets</strong>
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, many knowledge assets may be derived from other knowledge assets
(in part or in whole) as a means to reuse and repurpose the content of the
knowledge asset from which they were derived.  For example, a CPGMetric may
derive much of its content from a CPGRecommendation.  Derived knowledge assets
may be wholly or partially derived from other assets.

<strong>Translation within and between Knowledge Representations</strong>
</p>
<p>
Some knowledge assets may be represented using multiple alternative formalisms
(expressions and declarations), yet express the same meaning and intent
resulting in identical behavior when reasoning over identical inputs (data
elements).  This equivalence in computational intent and behavior is known as
isopragmatism.  This affords the ability to transform (and/or translate) between
different formalisms of the same knowledge content.  Isopragmatic
transformations between such knowledge representations is the knowledge
equivalent of iso-semantic transformations between different combinations of
information model + terminologies.  Reasons to use alternative, isopragmatic
representations of knowledge assets include ease-of-use of tooling (e.g. one
representation has more capable authoring and/or validation tools) as well as
the capabilities that exist within alternative delivery mechanisms and/or
implementation environments.  For more on isopragmatic knowledge representations
see the BPM+ section in Methodology.
