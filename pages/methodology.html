<p>Within the overall framework of knowledge engineering described in the <a href="approach.html">approach</a> page, this implementation guide describes a methodology for moving between the knowledge levels. Note that this
methodology emphasizes that the knowledge levels are a continuum of knowledge representation, they are
not intended to be rigidly interpreted discrete categories, rather they serve as a framework for
discussing successively more structured and formal representations of knowledge content to aid in
the understanding, communication, and implementation of guideline content.</p>

<p><em>Figure 3.1</em> Types of implementation guides: Specification, model, and content IGs</p>

<p>Figure 3.1, FHIR-based Knowledge Representation Specifications, depicts four categories of specifications, with representative examples of each category, illustrating how the various pieces can be used together to deliver shareable clinical reasoning artifacts.</p>

<p>Following this model, a computable guideline is a FHIR Content Implementation Guide, and specifically, a content IG that _conforms_ to the profiles and conformance requirements established by the CPG-on-FHIR IG.</p>

<p>This following sections describe this diagram and the related specifications in more detail, and the subsequent sections of this topic summarize the conformance requirements and the proposed structuring and packaging methodology.</p>

<h4>Foundational Standards</h4>

<p>The foundational standards on the bottom row of the diagram include the layers of FHIR, as well as expression language and integration standards including FHIRPath, Clinical Quality Language (CQL), CDS Hooks, and SMART.</p>

<ul>
  <li>FHIR includes five layers of concepts, each shown as an icon on the bottom row of the diagram.
    <ul>
      <li>Foundation layer – defines the core data exchange protocol.</li>
      <li>Conformance layer – defines how resources, profiles, and terminologies are represented and used.</li>
      <li>Administration layer – defines individuals, locations, organizations, and encounters.</li>
      <li>Clinical layer – defines clinical information such as observations, medications, procedures, and orders.</li>
      <li>Reasoning layer – provides definitional artifacts like plan and activity definitions, libraries, and measures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>FHIRPath is a simple, yet powerful, model-independent expression language that is used extensively throughout FHIR to describe paths to elements on resources, and to define invariants on profiles.</li>
  <li>Clinical Quality Language (CQL) is a superset of FHIRPath that provides an author-friendly format for the description of clinical logic, as well as a machine-friendly format for processing the logic.</li>
  <li>CDS Hooks is an HL7 standard specification for integrating decision support services with clinical systems. It is primarily focused on clinician-facing remote decision support within an EHR.</li>
  <li>SMART-on-FHIR (SMART) is an HL7 standard specification for integrating clinical applications into EMRs using FHIR.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Model Implementation Guides</h4>

<p>The middle row on the left of the Figure 4 shows the Model Implementation Guides (IGs), typically derived from FHIR Administration and Clinical resources such as Patient, Encounter, and MedicationRequest. These Model IGs are typically built to address a broad range of use cases, focused on a particular target realm or domain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>International Patient Summary (IPS) is a set of internationally applicable FHIR profiles used to share an extract of essential patient healthcare information across international boundaries. As a result, it forms an excellent foundation for expressing universally applicable content guidelines such as the WHO Antenatal Care (WHO ANC).</li>
  <li>US Core is a set of profiles focused on enabling exchange of the US Clinical Data for Interoperability (USCDI) and is supported by a broad range of EMR vendors within the US.</li>
  <li>QI-Core is a set of profiles that derives from US Core to enable quality improvement use cases such as quality measurement and decision support within the US.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Specification Implementation Guides</h4>

<p>The middle row on the right of the Figure 4 shows the Specification Implementation Guides, which derive from the FHIR Clinical Reasoning resources to provide implementation guidance and conformance requirements for the creation, distribution, evaluation, and maintenance of shareable clinical knowledge. These include the Quality Measure IG (QM), Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM), the Clinical Practice Guidelines IG (CPG-on-FHIR), and Evidence-based Medicine on FHIR (EBM-on-FHIR).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quality Measure IG (QM) provides guidance on and conformance requirements for the use of the FHIR Reasoning resources, Measure and Library, to create and share clinical quality measures.</li>
  <li>Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM) provides guidance for reporting quality measures.</li>
  <li>Structured Data Capture (SDC) provides guidance for building and capturing structured data using questionnaires</li>
  <li>Clinical Practice Guidelines IG (CPG-on-FHIR) demonstrates how to build shareable computable guideline content.</li>
  <li>Evidence-Based Medicine on FHIR (EBM-on-FHIR) provides interoperability (standards for data exchange) for those producing, analyzing, synthesizing, disseminating and implementing clinical research (evidence) and recommendations for clinical care (clinical practice guidelines). It specifies resources and patterns for the exchange of data involved in evidence-based medicine including study results, quality of evidence and strength of recommendation and relevant context, environmental surveys, and systematic reviews.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Content Implementation Guides</h4>

<p>In the top row of Figure 4, the Content Implementation Guides are FHIR Implementation Guides. These IGs are not necessarily balloted as HL7 standards; rather, they use the FHIR publication toolchain to support authoring and distribution as depicted in the rest of the diagram. The content is stewarded by separate authorities such as quality agencies and guideline developers; groups that have their own governance and maintenance policies. The content IGs conform to the specification IGs on the right of row 2, and typically make use of the model IGs on the left of row 2 to define content focused on a particular realm.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HEDIS IG contains Healthcare and Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures expressed using FHIR Reasoning Measure and Library resources and conforming to the Quality Measure IG (QM) profiles.</li>
  <li>CDC Opioid Prescribing IG contains decision support content to streamline guideline implementation regarding the use of opioids for chronic pain in clinical settings.</li>
  <li>World Health Organization Antenatal Care (WHO ANC) IG contains decision support content to streamline guideline implementation regarding antenatal care.</li>
</ul>

<a name="structuring"> </a>
<h3><span class="sectioncount">3.2.0</span> Structuring Content <a href="methodology.html#structuring" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p>Broadly, the methodology identified in this implementation guide will produce:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Elements: FHIR profiles and terminologies that characterize the data elements involved in the recommendation statements</li>
  <li>Libraries: CQL libraries that characterize the logic used in data elements, rules, and behaviors in the recommendation statements</li>
  <li>Recommendations: FHIR PlanDefinition and ActivityDefinition instances that establish the rules and behaviors of the recommendation statements</li>
  <li>Guidance: Associated documentation and guidance, delivered in the form of a FHIR content implementation guide</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="documentation-recommendations.html">Structuring Recommendations</a> topic describes this methodology in more detail.</p>

<a name="grading-content"> </a>
<h3><span class="sectioncount">3.3.0</span> Grading Content <a href="methodology.html#grading-content" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Clinical guideline content typically assigns ratings for aspects of guidance such as the quality of evidence, or the strength of the recommendation. However, due to the broad range of use cases and rating needs, different guidelines use different rating systems and grading characteristics to communicate this information. This implementation provides support for the following rating concepts:

* [Quality of Evidence](http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-cqf-qualityofevidence.html)
* [Strength of Recommendation](http://hl7.org/fhir/extension-cqf-strengthofrecommendation.html)
* [Direction of Recommendation](StructureDefinition-cpg-directionOfRecommendation.html)

Due to the variability in rating systems among guideline content, this implementation is not prescriptive about what grading system should be used, and the example bindings from the base specification apply. However, content conforming to this implementation guide SHALL identify a rating system and use that to provide rating information for recommendations and guidance, and provide documentation on what rating system was selected and how it is communicated through the content.

The [CPGComputablePlanDefinition](StructureDefinition-cpg-computableplandefinition.html) profile establishes the qualityOfEvidence, strengthOfRecommendation, and directionOfRecommendation extensions as appropriate for use on PlanDefinition instances to communicate ratings.

> NOTE: The CPG-on-FHIR project is seeking feedback on whether this implementation guide should nominate a specific grading system and require conforming content to provide mappings when they use other grading systems.

<a name="checklists"> </a>
<h3><span class="sectioncount">3.4.0</span> Checklists <a href="methodology.html#checklists" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help facilitate the process of communication of requirements between collaborators, and to provide a measure of completeness with respect to artifacts used in and developed as part of this methodology, this implementation guide provides three checklists, associated with the semi-structured, structured, and executable knowledge representation levels. These checklists are intended as a tool to help identify requirements and ensure completeness of artifacts:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="L2Checklist.html">L2 Checklist</a>: Used to help verify completeness of an L2 artifact</li>
    <li><a href="L3Checklist.html">L3 Checklist</a>: Used to help verify completeness of an L3 artifact</li>
    <li><a href="L4Checklist.html">L4 Checklist</a>: Used to help with implementation/deployment of an L3 artifact as L4</li>
  </ul>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">3.5.0</span> Conformance Requirements <a href="methodology.html#conformance" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p>The <a href="documentation-conformance.html">Conformance</a> topic summarizes the conformance requirements established by this implementation guide.</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">3.7.0</span> Mapping and Other Formalisms <a href="methodology.html#other-formalisms" title="link to here" class="self-link"><img src="target.png" width="20" class="self-link" height="20"/></a></h3>

<p>The primary methodology discussed in this implementation guide uses FHIR resources to represent both patient information and the computable content of a guideline. There are other approaches, and the <a href="documentation-methodology.html">Mapping to BPM+</a> topic discusses how the FHIR representations can be bi-directionally mapped to and from BPM+ content.</p>
