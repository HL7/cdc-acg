<h1>Guideline Development</h1>
<p>
Guideline development is a community of practice consisting of numerous
professionals with expertise and skills in various fields.  This implementation
guide does not describe the guideline development process in complete detail,
however, it does give a fairly thorough overview to provide sufficient context
for the rest of the implementation guide as the scope for the CPG is to provide
a computer-interpretable representation of the end work product of this process.

Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist
clinical practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate care for specific
clinical conditions, procedures, and/or similarly scoped activities. Guidelines
consist of recommendations for patient care, which are based on scientific
research and data (evidence), vetted through rigorous processes of a review and
synthesis by recognized domain and methodological experts and other key
stakeholders (e.g. patient and caregiver advocates) to guide healthcare
decisions and activities for defined scope. A guideline may consist of one or
more recommendations, contextualizing information, the possible means or
strategies for bringing together or orchestrating recommendations, and other
relevant considerations. A recommendation is a proposal pertaining to the best
course of action put forth by an authoritative source or body (e.g. governmental
or professional society convened guideline development group).  More detailed
descriptions of and best practices for the guideline development process may be
found at numerous publicly available resources (e.g.,  <a

) and are beyond the scope of this document, though a few key concepts will be
covered.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/CPG-04-00.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guideline Development Group</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The guideline development group is the multi-stakeholder, cross-functional team
assembled to develop the guideline. It often includes members from the target
audience (specialist and primary care clinicians), content experts, patients and
caregivers, front-line clinicians, evidence-based practice experts, outcomes and
quality experts, usability experts, experts in medical and shared
decision-making, methodology experts, and experts in health economics. (<a
href="https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#GuidelineGroupMembershiptable">https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#GuidelineGroupMembershiptable</a>).
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scoping</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Scoping refers to the process and establishment of criteria to describe and
constrain the focus of the guideline. It addresses who is the target user of the
guideline, who it applies to, and what is addressed in the guideline. The PICOTS
Typology (i.e., population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timeframe) is
often used in scoping and correlates closely to the eligibility criteria for the
CPG  (<a
href="https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#Prioritytable">https://cebgrade.mcmaster.ca/guidelinechecklistonline.html#Prioritytable</a>).
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guideline Development Frameworks </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following Frameworks are used in Guideline development and across the
evidence ecosystem:
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Synthesis and the Evidence Pyramid</strong>
<p>
    Knowledge synthesis is the process in professional community of practice
that applies and develops methodologies for systematically evaluating a corpus
of evidence related to a particular condition or intervention.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/CPG-04-01.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
    The Evidence Pyramid refers to a means to evaluate the quality or validity
of evidence (higher toward the top) as well as provide a visual depiction of the
amount of evidence (width) (ref).  The evaluation of the evidence not only
informs the guideline development process and resulting recommendations but is
further communicated together with the recommendations themselves using the
GRADE framework, described below.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PICOTS Typology</strong>- Patient population, Intervention,
Comparator, Outcomes, Timing, Setting. For more on using PICOTS within HL7
Standards, see the EBM-on-FHIR IG.
<ol>
<li><strong>GRADE (G</strong>rades of <strong>R</strong>ecommendation
<strong>A</strong>ssessment, <strong>D</strong>evelopment and
<strong>E</strong>valuation<strong>)</strong>- GRADE describes a process and a
structured framework for conveying information to develop a common, transparent,
and sensible system for grading the <strong>quality</strong> of evidence and the
<strong>strength</strong> of recommendations.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>The CPG enables the System Level of the 6S Pyramid and Learning Health
Systems</strong>
</p>
<p>
The 6S Evidence Pyramid is another framing on the quality or validity of the
evidence that may be of particular interest to the CPG-IG (implementation guide)
 (ref).  The highest level is Systems where information from the lower levels of
the hiearchy are integrated with individual patient records (e.g., CPG content
delivered into clinical workflow using real-world evidence with patient data)
</p>

evidence into direct patient care) at the peak.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/CPG-04-03.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
    The Learning Health System is another perspective on integrating evidence
directly into practice and then using practice-level data to further inform
evidence (ref)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Evidence, Guidance, and Rapid Ascent to the Peak During an Emergency
Response to a Novel Contagion Pandemic:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Clearly there are many benefits to enable such a “peak of the pyramid” approach
to tightly integrating guideline-directed care and cycling the “Learning Health
System” for any condition and at any point in time.  Many of the approaches,
capabilities, best practices, tools, and techniques described in this
implementation guide are certainly as, if not even more, relevant to these
situations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapid Discovery of Best Practice</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapid dissemination of Practice Guidance</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rapid-cyle, closed loop Knowledge-to-Delivery-to-Discovery with feedback
loops</strong>
</p>
<p>
Data-to-Evidence-to-Knowledge-to-Practice; or
Guidance-to-Practice-to-Data-to-Evidence-to-Knowledge-to-Practice.
</p>
<h2><strong>Analysis of Evidence</strong></h2>
<p>
Analysis of evidence includes systematic approaches for evaluating the evidence
to inform the guideline and individual recommendations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Information from the Evidence:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There is a significant amount of information contained within the various
evidence sources.  PICOTS as described above is one systematic means of
extracting information from the evidence that may be particularly useful in the
CPG.
</p>
<p>
<strong>EBM-on-FHIR for Information from the Evidence:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The evidence contains valuable information that is not only used in the
guideline development process, but often for and in the guideline and
recommendations themselves.  This information may be formalized as explicit
knowledge using the EBM-on-FHIR IG and its evidence resources and evidence
variable(s).  This may include the various PICOTS variables from the evidence
being formalized using standard terminologies (e.g., RxNorm, LOINC, SNOMED-CT)
and expression languages (e.g., HL7 CQL) and will be discussed further
elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    The formalization of this information from the evidence provides significant
advantage (reuse or at least a reasonable starting point to work from) in the
formalization of the guideline and guideline recommendations in the knowledge
engineering lifecycle process for the CPG.
</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>
Recommendations are proposals pertaining to the best course of action put forth
by an authoritative source or body related to a condition, procedure, clinical
decision, or activity. Often, they also call out portions of a recommendation
and/or how the recommendations hang together that lack evidence and may have
relied on expert consensus.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, if the guideline development group includes measure development
expertise, it may provide guidance on whether each recommendation could be a
good candidate for performance/quality measurement.
</p>
<h2><strong>Reporting and Dissemination</strong></h2>
<p>
Reporting is often done through an official, formal guideline report intended
for a target audience. Dissemination to measure development organizations,
CLinical Decision Support (CDS) vendors, EHR vendors, registry vendors, and/or
SMART-on-FHIR application developers could be included for computable CPGs.
</p>
<h2><strong>Development of Computable Clinical Guideline Artifacts</strong></h2>
<h3>Evidence</h3>
<p>
Evidence and information from the evidence used and referenced in the guideline
recommendations may be formalized as FHIR Evidence Resources with their
respective Evidence Variables using the EBM-on-FHIR IG.  Similarly, the
published guideline narrative may be formalized through the same approach using
this CPG-on-FHIR IG..
</p>
<h3>CPG Content and Related Derivatives</h3>
<p>
<strong>Recommendations: </strong>In the CPG context, recommendations are
represented and expressed through a profile on the FHIR Plan Definition
(CPG_Recommendation) largely derived from the ECA Rule profile.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Guideline &amp; Strategies:</strong>  The broader guideline includes
strategies for relating, sequencing, or orchestrating individual (or groups of)
recommendations and is represented and expressed through separate profiles on
the  FHIR Plan Definition (CPG_Pathway and CPG_Strategy).
<ol>
<li><strong>Metrics and Measures:</strong>  A CPG_Metric is a patient level
measurement or indicator of recommendation compliance and/or guideline adherence
(corresponding to a process measure), reaching a stated goal or objective
(corresponding to an end or intermediate outcome), or current status of a
clinical activity.  A CPG_Measure is a population level measurement typically
corresponding to an aggregate of patient level CPG_Metrics and/or other parts of
the CPG.
<ol>
<li><strong>eCaseReport:</strong>  A CPG_eCaseReport is intended to convey the
set of data elements required to provide for more detailed outcomes research on
the guideline topic itself as well as for a feedback loop for continuous
improvement of the specified guideline.  The data elements for a CPG_eCaseReport
come from the data requirements (CPG_CaseFeatures), key inferences thereof
(inferred CPG_CaseFeatures), patient specific recommendations (CPG_Proposals),
and the corresponding orders and resulting clinical activities (requests and
resultant events from CPG_CaseFeatures).
<p>
    <strong>Value to Stakeholders:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>For guideline development groups, especially Medical Specialty Societies-
<li>For Providers and health care organizations
<li>For the Evidence Ecosystem
<li>For modern and emerging methods of Knowledge Discovery
</li>
