<h1>Tiers of Functionality</h1>
<p>
This implementation guide defines three (3) tiers of functionality, very roughly
analogous to the tiers of architecture in software engineering:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong>  (Data ELements)
<li><strong>Logic</strong>  (Clinical Logic)
<li><strong>Forms</strong>  (UI Description and Behavior)
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<em>Tiers of Functionality</em>
</p>
<p>
To illustrate these tiers of functionality, consider the following excerpt from
a recommendation statement in the CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline:
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>When prescribing opioids for chronic pain, providers should use
urine drug testing before starting opioid therapy</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
The data elements in this recommendation statement are the concepts involved,
such as medication prescriptions, opioids, chronic pain, urine drug testing, and
opioid therapy.
</p>
<p>
The clinical logic then describes the behaviors in terms of the data elements,
such as “when prescribing opioids for chronic pain”, and “use urine drug testing
before starting opioid therapy.”
</p>
<p>
And finally, the forms descriptions are the user interfaces involved in the
implementation of the recommendation, such as an order entry form.
</p>
<p>
Note that these tiers each have different manifestations at different knowledge
levels. At L3, these tiers are formal but still conceptual representations of
the content, whereas at L4, these tiers are concretely implemented in software
systems. For example, a form at L3 is intentionally silent on the actual
presentation layer details, whereas a form at L4 necessarily includes them.  See
section on Levels of Representation by Tiers of Functionality
</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Elements
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The data elements provide a computable representation of the concepts and
information within  the clinical guideline. The artifacts at this level are
represented in FHIR using the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>StructureDefinition - Specifically, profiles and extensions
<li>CodeSystem
<li>ValueSet
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Expressing the data elements in a clinical guideline enables the description and
exchange of the within the guideline; roughly, the data tier in a traditional
3-tier architecture.  While much logic at the data level is abstracted away
behind interfaces (a key benefit of FHIR), one much be careful not to conflate
data transformation and clinical business logic, particularly in the case of
inferred and/or enriched data elements (e.g. inferred CPGCaseFeatures).  The
inference belongs in the Clinical Logic layer.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Clinical Logic
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The clinical logic in a computable guideline provides a formal representation of
the behavior involved in the recommendation statements in terms of the data
elements. This includes inclusion/exclusion criteria, calculations such as risk
scores, public health indicators, or average daily dosage, as well as rules that
describe how and when a recommendation applies such as event-condition-action
rules. The artifacts at this level are represented in FHIR using the following
resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Library
<li>ActivityDefinition
<li>PlanDefinition
<li>Measure
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Expressing the clinical logic for a guideline enables application functionality;
roughly, the application tier in a traditional 3-tier architecture.
</p>
<p>
Note to the Knowledge Engineer not to conflate Clinical (business) Logic with
either Data (transformation) logic or Forms (user interaction) logic.  Business
logic should only be about describing the things that occur in the domain-
describing patients (CPGCaseFeatures), formalizing clinician decision logic
(CPGRecommendations), orchestrating either of the two, etc. (see Table above).
These are critical separations of concerns to keep in mind as their conflation
can cause significant challenges, particularly in a knowledge-based approach-
though all Tiers can take advantage of knowledge-based approaches.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Forms Description
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The forms description in a computable guideline describes user interactions and
uses both the data elements and clinical logic. The artifacts at this level are
represented in FHIR using the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Questionnaire
<li>PlanDefinition
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This level involves specifying a conceptual description of the processes
involved, as well as the user-interfaces that capture the user’s interactions
with the system. Expressing the forms description for a guideline provides a
more complete description of the recommendations in a guideline; roughly, the
presentation tier in a traditional 3-tier architecture.  Note to the Knowledge
Engineer not to conflate Forms logic with Business Logic.  Forms logic should
only be about the behavior of the user interaction, though it can and almost
always does reuse Business Logic.  This is a critical separation of concerns to
keep in mind.
