<h3><strong>Knowledge Acquisition</strong></h3>
<p>
Knowledge acquisition is the process of extracting, understanding, structuring
and organizing knowledge from one source, often solely or largely from human/
expert understandable formats, so it can be translated into
computer-interpretable (or computer-enabled) formalisms.  Knowledge acquisition
typically includes one or more of the following sub-activities: knowledge
elicitation, knowledge authoring, knowledge synthesis, knowledge discovery (data
mining-machine learning DM-ML), and/or hybrid approaches that may include
methods, tools, and information gained from a combination of the prior
approaches.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Elicitation</strong>:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge elicitation is the process of extracting an expert’s tacit knowledge
(i.e., expertise and experience) or expert-sourced artifacts (e.g., narrative
guidelines) to obtain a more formalizable representation of this knowledge.
Techniques may include: expert interviews, ethnographic methodologies (e.g.,
artifact analysis, shadowing, retrospective cued recall interviews, critical
decision method, contextual inquiry, case presentations or reviews, Delphi
method [a forecasting process framework based on the results of multiple rounds
of questionnaires sent to a panel of experts], concept mapping [a visual diagram
that depicts concepts, their attributes, and suggested relationships between
them from a domain perspective]).
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Authoring:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge authoring is the process by which a domain expert directly expresses
their tacit knowledge into more formalized representations of this knowledge.
This is often done using tools such as editors that facilitate the knowledge
translation process through business logic affordances and constraints) in the
tooling that provide mappings from domain concepts (e.g.,  expert mental models)
to knowledge representations derived from knowledge asset meta-models defined by
knowledge architects as well as pre-existing content from an established
knowledge base (e.g., ontologies and terminologies).
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Synthesis: </strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge synthesis is a process and set of techniques that  evaluates and
summarizes all available evidence on a particular topic through comprehensive
literature searches and advanced qualitative and quantitative synthesis methods.
 This is analogous, if not identical to the knowledge synthesis and
evidence-based practice communitiy’s evidence analysis approach utilized by the
guideline development group as described above.  This is an opportunity for many
touch points between the guideline development group in the knowledge
engineering team.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Discovery:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge discovery is a process of discovering or learning patterns that lead
to actionable knowledge from large data sets.  This may be inclusive of various
traditional data mining or data exploration approaches and tooling, numerous ML
approaches, and/or combinations thereof.  It may also be inclusive of various
health outcomes research and data science activities and may built upon large
curated data sets (e.g., clinical, clinical research, and quality improvement
registries; -omics data sets) as well as real-world evidence and metadata or
insights from across the evidence ecosystem (e.g., knowledge synthesis outputs,
clinical trial metadata).  These methods of knowledge acquisition provide
affordances and much promise for inputs from various CPG activities (e.g.,
content formalization and data enrichment expression such as inferred
CPG_CaseFeatures) and feedback loops (e.g., eCaseReports).
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There is extraordinary value, critical efficiencies, and unique perspectives
that can be gleaned from each of these knowledge acquisition approaches.  In
addition to knowledge gained from combining insights from each of these
communities of practice, there are valuable knowledge and gains in efficiency in
combining techniques and tooling as well as more discrete fragments of knowledge
gained within subactivities across these communities (called transdisciplinary
and/or hybrid approaches).
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In Collaboration with the Guideline Development Group:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A key tenant of the CPG development process is for the knowledge engineering
team to leverage early, often engagement and even integration with guideline
development group. This allows the knowledge engineering team to start acquiring
knowledge and translating it further upstream in the CPG development process.
It further enables feedback and more rapid iteration between the knowledge
engineering team and the domain experts in the guideline development group.
</p>
<p>
A key tenant of the Agile CPG approach describe subsequently, is to further
integrate the knowledge engineering team and guideline development group into a
nearly singular cross-functional team.  Benefits include fewer handoffs and
queues, concurrency of work efforts, shorter and more valuable feedback loops,
and higher-quality inputs to knowledge acquisition (people and processes versus
a paper narrative to be interpreted subsequently to and asynchronously with the
guideline development group’s and artifacts).  Lastly, but none of least
importance is the ability for the guideline development group in the knowledge
engineering team to learn together.  Additional benefits and work processes are
described subsequently.

<ol>
<li><strong>In Collaboration with Knowledge Implementers:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge acquisition approaches may further leverage the benefits of working
directly with knowledge implementers, not limited to potential representative
data sets (e.g de-identified data) to perform early knowledge specification and
validation activities (e.g. data elements and terminologies) or even employ
knowledge discovery approaches as described above.  Even CPGCaseFeature
definitions (including inferred) or explicit recommendation semantics may be
informed by various local implementation artifacts (e.g. CDS content, local
clinical registry data elements and logic, workflow analysis artifacts).  For
further descriptions, see section on Concurrent Development and Implementation
in Knowledge Implementation.
