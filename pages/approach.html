<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Approach section of this implementation guide describes how guideline developers, informaticians (knowledge engineers and others), and implementers of computable representations of guidelines can collaborate across the lifecycle of guideline-directed care and related activities (clinical decision support, quality measurement, case reporting, continuous improvement), leveraging existing standards-based approaches.</p>

<p>Broadly, the approach taken by this implementation guide is to establish a conceptual architecture that identifies key domain concepts, artifacts, and patterns used in the description and delivery of clinical guidance, along with a framework for characterizing the nature and usage of artifacts within that conceptual architecture, ultimately advocating for an agile, cross-functional approach to guideline development.</p>

<p>The Approach documentation includes sections intended to describe the work effort and products of each of the key roles in the development lifecycle of a computable Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG). While the approach is not a step-by-step guide using specific tools and techniques, it does attempt to provide enough context to orient all contributors to the collective work to be undertaken, to provide a framework for undertaking such collaborative work, and to provide enough detail to inform the development, translation, and representation of a clinical guideline into the CPG knowledge architecture as characterized in machine-readable form by the CPG Profiles and conformance requirements defined in this implementation guide.</p>

<a href="documentation-approach-03-conformance-levels.html">Levels of Conformance and Enablement</a>

<p>This section discusses trade-offs between effort, time to develop, and capabilities enabled (and value that can be derived) when developing a CPG. From very basic context for narrative snippets searchable in a library (or Infobutton from EHR) to full clinical workflow enablement, cognitive support, and pathway tracking (likely via SMART-on-FHIR App or deep EHR integration) as well as feedback loops with real-world evidence of actual guideline usage, measures, etc. and as substrate for evidence ecosystem and/or feedforward loop for evidence updates.  Fortunately, the CPG-IG includes levels of enablement that correlate to work effort, time to delivery, as well as capabilities that it can support as well as the means to iteratively, and successively develop CPG versions that provide incremental value by ascending these levels of enablement.</p>

<a href="documentation-approach-04-guideline-development.html">Guideline Development</a>

<p>Guideline development involves systematic review of evidence related to specific clinical question(s) and then producing a set of recommendations and supporting information.  This implementation guide provides sufficient context for developing a computer-interpretable representation of the final work product of the guideline development process.</p>

<p>Recommendations are proposals pertaining to the best course of action put forth by an authoritative source or body related to a condition, procedure, clinical decision, or activity.</p>

<h5 id="metrics-and-measures"><strong>Metrics and Measures</strong></h5>

<h6 id="a-metric-vs-a-measure"><strong>A Metric vs a Measure</strong></h6>

<p>Metric: Case features, goals, and recommended activities that are relevant for measurement and directly derivable from following the clinical practice guideline. (i.e. these are naturally occurring data that arise from the delivery of guideline-based care, also called “indicators”, also called “continuous variable measures” or event “supplemental data” in the measurement space. Note that there will likely be several different patterns of metrics, e.g. process real/time, process retrospective, intermediate outcome real/time and retrospective, time-bounded, etc.</p>

<p>Measure: Self-contained quality measure that is developed independently and has its own development lifecycle, see the Quality Measure IG. May not directly fall out of the CPG. For example, beta-blockers fall out of the admission strategy, but the medasure is looking for beta-blockers on discharge. Measures may relate to the CPG, or even specific parts of the CPG, and can potentially reuse aspects of the CPG such as goals, feuaters, and recommended activities. CPGs could also be used to complement pre-existing measures derived from clinical guidelines (this will be noted using relatedArtifact).</p>

<p>The Knowledge Engineering Lifecycle Process describes a progressively interdependent series of activities or steps taken in order to transform domain knowledge/content into a more formal, computable set of assets for consumption, execution, and/or delivery.</p>

<p>Steps in the Knowledge engineering Lifecycle include:</p>

  <li>Knowledge Acquisition</li>
  <li>Knowledge Translation</li>
  <li>Knowledge Representation/Expression</li>

FIG. 06. Knowledge Translation is the dynamic and iterative process of conveying the concepts, clinical logic, and intent of a source knowledge expression (e.g., narrative guideline) into an equivalent expression in another language or formalism- in the case of a narrative guideline into a computeable or computer interpretable expression. This may occur successively or progressively across the Levels of Representation (L1, L2, L3) or may be directly to an L3/L4 expression, typically using an authoring tool or domain-oriented language.

FIG. 14. The Plan describes Recommendations for best practice care including many aspects of the clinical decision-making processes in the context of patients’ current and historical state (i.e., Case, and scoped Case Features); Strategies for addressing key clinical issues that may require decisions, planning, and orchestration across multiple recommendations; and an overall Pathway that similarly coordinates across Strategies and Recommendations to be applied to individual patients in the broader collective of the Case and its Case Features resulting in a patient-specific Care Plan.  The Plan is “definitional” and is represented by [FHIR Resources that follow the Definition](http://hl7.org/fhir/definition.html) pattern.  If logic describes what to do for a patient, it likely belongs in the Plan.
