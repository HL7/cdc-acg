<h1>Knowledge Engineering Overview</h1>
<p>
Knowledge Engineering (KE) is the discipline and profession of developing
formal, explicit representations of domain-oriented logic in computer systems
(knowledge-based systems) in order to try to simulate human decision-making and
high-level cognitive tasks. A knowledge engineer supplies or develops some or
all of the logic within a particular domain, which includes expressions of the
objects and relations in the domain that is built into or used by computational
systems.

<p>
In healthcare, knowledge engineers are further specialized with expertise that
may span from those with deep domain understanding including knowledge
elicitation tools and techniques with some familiarity with various knowledge
representation formalisms to deep understanding of knowledge formalism (i.e.,
representation/ expression) and knowledge architecture (i.e., knowledge
processes and technology requirements for creating, capturing, organizing,
accessing and using knowledge assets with varying degrees of familiarity with
the domain.)
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, some knowledge engineers are very specialized in a particular
knowledge representation level (see below) and or functional tier such as data
modelers, terminologists, ontologists, and expression language (e.g., CQL)
authors. Likewise, some knowledge engineers are very specialized in a healthcare
domain (e.g., cardiology), broad domain conceptualizations and their respective
formalisms (e.g., pathways, measures), or specialized methodologies that play a
critical role in the overall knowledge engineering process (e.g., knowledge
synthesis).
</p>
<p>
There are a few, experienced informaticians and knowledge architects that play a
broader systems engineering (i.e., designing, integrating, and managing complex
systems over their life cycles) role on a knowledge engineering team to bring
the information, assets, processes, and individual knowledge engineers together,
in part, through shared knowledge architecture and use of standardized
representations (e.g., composite assets, terminologies, standards) as well as
tooling (e.g., editors, validation tooling).

activities and information.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge Engineering Lifecycle Process
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The knowledge engineering lifecycle process describes a progressively
interdependent series of activities or steps taken in order to transform domain
knowledge or content into a more formal computable set of assets for
consumption, execution, and/or delivery.  Furthermore, it describes many of the
sub-activities and their work products as well as their interdependencies and
generalized information flow. These activities, work products, and information
have a generalized flow, however as discussed below in Agile KE, many of these
activities and their derivatives run concurrently, have numerous touch points,
and are done iteratively. These various flows occur between and across the
various tiers of functionality (i.e., data, logic, user interface), levels of
representation (i.e., narrative to computable), and knowledge formalisms (i.e.,
asset types, representations, and expressions) as presented in further detail
below. Here we will briefly describe the high-level activities in the knowledge
engineering lifecycle process, though much more detailed descriptions of these
activities and their corresponding subactivies, methodologies, and tooling are
available in various resources provided by respective communities of practice.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Acquisition</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge acquisition is the process of extracting, understanding, structuring
and organizing knowledge from one source, often solely or largely from human/
expert understandable formats, so it can be translated into
computer-interpretable (or computer-enabled) formalisms.  Knowledge acquisition
typically includes one or more of the following sub-activities: knowledge
elicitation, knowledge authoring, knowledge synthesis, knowledge discovery (data
mining-machine learning DM-ML), and/or hybrid approaches that may include
methods, tools, and information gained from a combination of the prior
approaches.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Elicitation</strong>:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge elicitation is the process of extracting an expert’s tacit knowledge
(i.e., expertise and experience) or expert-sourced artifacts (e.g., narrative
guidelines) to obtain a more formalizable representation of this knowledge.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Authoring:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge authoring is the process by which a domain expert directly expresses
their tacit knowledge into more formalized representations of this knowledge.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Synthesis: </strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge synthesis is a process and set of techniques that  evaluates and
summarizes all available evidence on a particular topic through comprehensive
literature searches and advanced qualitative and quantitative synthesis methods.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Discovery:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge discovery is a process of discovering or learning patterns that lead
to actionable knowledge from large data sets.  This may be inclusive of various
traditional data mining or data exploration approaches and tooling, numerous ML
approaches, and/or combinations thereof.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
There is extraordinary value, critical efficiencies, and unique perspectives
that can be gleaned from each of these knowledge acquisition approaches.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In Collaboration with the Guideline Development Group:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
A key tenant of the CPG development process is for the knowledge engineering
team to leverage early, often engagement and even integration with guideline
development group. This allows the knowledge engineering team to start acquiring
knowledge and translating it further upstream in the CPG development process.
It further enables feedback and more rapid iteration between the knowledge
engineering team and the domain experts in the guideline development group.

<ol>
<li><strong>In Collaboration with Knowledge Implementers:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge acquisition approaches may further leverage the benefits of working
directly with knowledge implementers, not limited to potential representative
data sets (e.g de-identified data) to perform early knowledge specification and
validation activities (e.g. data elements and terminologies) or even employ
knowledge discovery approaches.

</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Translation</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge translation occurs between and across various levels of knowledge
representation,  from narrative to semi-structured to structured to executable
(described in detail below in “Knowledge Representation” section) as well as
between equivalent forms of a given knowledge asset.

</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Representation/ Expression:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge representation pertains to the process of progressively structuring
and formalizing content for computer interpretation and enablement and will be
discussed in more detail in the "Knowledge Representation" section below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Knowledge Curation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Knowledge curation is the activity of identifying, versioning, indexing, tagging
(i.e., adding metadata), and archiving the various artifacts and assets (e.g.,
representations, formalisms, expression libraries) relevant to the scoped
knowledge engineering activity. The primary purpose for knowledge curation is to
facilitate search and retrieval of relevant content.
</p>
<h3><strong>Knowledge Management:</strong></h3>
<p>
Knowledge management has substantive ties to  knowledge engineering, knowledge
representation, knowledge creation, and knowledge sharing and further extends
the broader concept of curation.  Knowledge management refers to the processes,
capabilities, and tooling for identifying, organizing, relating, finding,
sharing, and reusing knowledge assets (see section on “Knowledge
Representation”).
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Execution:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge execution refers to the processes of binding computable knowledge
formalisms to data for the purpose of generating new information and insights.
Details of knowledge execution are beyond the scope of this document, but has
implications largely addressed in the section on “Methods of Implementation”.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Validation:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge validation refers to verifying that the various knowledge formalisms
faithfully, specifically, and unambiguously perform as intended. Validation may
occur across tiers of functionality and levels of representation as well as for
varying degrees of composition across levels and tiers (L x T). Validation may
occur within and across various activities within the knowledge engineering
lifecycle development process.
</p>
<p>
Also see Test-driven Knowledge Engineering in Agile Approach to CPG Development
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Knowledge Implementation:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Knowledge implementation refers to the activities of localizing the knowledge
formalisms, including addressing data bindings (e.g., data and terminology
mappings), workflow insertions and localization factors (e.g., adjustments to
thresholds), integration to end-user system endpoint interfaces, and adjustment
or issues related to data quality, timing, enrichment, and/or required data
enrichments.  At minimum, there is a local data, clinical logic, and workflow
validation step prior to full implementation.
</p>
<p>
While local implementations of guideline recommendations may warrant their own
implementation guide, this implementation guide addresses several key factors
and considerations related to local implementation.  Native EHR build is out of
scope.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Local Content and Practice Governance:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Most large health care delivery organizations have practice governance oversight
bodies that may function in some degree like a guideline development group
utilizing local organizational experts and key stakeholders, inputs from their
own quality functions and research apparatus, and taking into account
organizational goals, objectives, and limitations.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/CPG-05-04.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
<strong>Local informatics (knowledge engineering) and implementation:</strong>
</p>
<p>
Just as many of the functions and methods of the guideline development group
have their local analogues, so does the knowledge engineering and guideline
formalization and implementation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concurrent Development and Implementation</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Given the similarities between and related activities of the CPG development
process and the local implementation of standardize best practices, there are
considerable opportunities for improving the effectiveness, efficiency,
implementability, and overall uptake (and enhancement) guideline recommendations
related best practices.
</p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/CPG-05-05.png" width="" alt="alt_text"
title="image_tooltip">
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Analogs and Collaboration across CPG Development and
Implementation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As described in more detail in the section on Knowledge Implementation,
there are numerous analogues between the guideline development group and local
practice governance as well as between the CPG knowledge engineering function
and local informatics and EHR build functions.  Likewise, as the guideline
development group and knowledge engineering function collaborate in the CPG
development process, so does the local practice governance and informatics/EHR
build function in the local knowledge implementation process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Feedback- early, often, actionable:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, such a collaboration provides an opportunity to engage and
address critical implementation concerns further upstream as well as afford
earlier, shorter, and actionable feedback loops into the overall best practice
to daily practice endeavor.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Real-world Data to Develop CPGs:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Such real-world data can not improve the quality (effectiveness and
implementability) of the CPG, it affords the opportunity to greatly accelerate
the knowledge engineering process and overall CPG development lifecycle.
Obviously, having more than one local implementation affords many benefits.
</p>
<p>
Further details of knowledge implementation are beyond the scope of this
document at this time, but have implications partially addressed in the section
on “Methods of Implementation.”
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Agile CPG Development Approach:</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This section will provide the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An Overview of Agile Principles and Methods
<li>Critical Aspects of Agile in Knowledge Engineering and CPG Development
<ul>
<li>Cross-functional, Integrated CPG Development Team
<li>“Chunking”
<li>Test-driven Knowledge Engineering
<li>Iteration, rapid-cycle feedback
<li>Leverage Knowledge Base (in an ‘intelligent’ Knowledge Content Management
System)
</li>
</ul>
<li>Also refer to the prior section on Knowledge Implementation for details on
cross-functional integration with Local Implementation teams and the benefits
thereof.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As implied by its name, Agile process and initiatives are able to move quickly
and easily as has been demonstrated and accepted best practice in the software
development industry.  Agile development is characterized by the division of
tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of
plans.
</p>
<p>
Characteristics of Agile include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Iterative, incremental, and evolutionary
<li>Cross-functional, tightly integrated teams with focus on delivery
<li>Very short feedback loop and adaptation cycle
<li>Integration of “build” and “test” phases (test-driven development)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Knowledge-driven systems principles and best practices must still be respected
and/or employed.
</p>
<p>
Relevant Agile Practices to be adapted to knowledge engineering function:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross functional teams
<li>Frequent, brief team communications (e.g. Scrum)
<li>Domain-driven design (focus on domain and domain logic, integration of
domain experts, based on model of domain- as is done in knowledge architecture
and knowledge-driven systems)
<li>Iterative and incremental development (e.g. Chunking)
<li>Low-code development platforms (e.g editors and authoring tools for domain
experts)
<li>Paired programming (e.g. SME knowledge engineer with technical/formalism
knowledge engineer)
<li>Retrospectives (e.g. continuous sharing of lessons learned)
<li>Specification by example (e.g. real “test cases” to aid in defining
requirements- including inputs and expected results for at least critical logic
paths)
<li>Test-driven development (e.g. start with few critical test cases, use short
iterations to create logic, and use it to aid in generating additional test
cases than are simply graded to be re-used for ‘build’ vs wholly generated
manually)
<li>Test-integration (e.g. testing of all individual and composite knowledge
assets/artifacts)
</li>
</ul>
