<p>CDC, through the Office of Public Health Scientific Services, is leading an initiative called "Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age." This enterprise-wide approach is working strategically to connect experts and solutions that can help ensure our most up-to-date scientific evidence is followed and results in desired outcomes. This initiative developed out of an agency-wide workgroup formed in 2016, and focuses specifically on improving the transmission of clinical guidelines by finding better ways to translate critical information into digital approaches or products.</p>
